### Log Notes:

* ‚ùñ For session #8, Del got 8 points instead 7 because of Rick's egregious puns.
* For session #13, Rick didn't understand that Callach is dead like Latin, not dead like ancient Egyptian, so it can still be spoken in a way that allows for casting spells.  One point was spent to retroactively allow Del to have Callach at Spoken: Broken.
* ‚ùñ For session #14, Del got 4 points instead 3 because of Rick's clever use of an improvised _Glass Wall_ spell.
* ‚ùñ For session #15, Del got 5 points instead 3 because of Rick's clever use of an improvised _Timeport_ spell.
* For session #17, Del spent 9 points on rerolls to stay alive.
