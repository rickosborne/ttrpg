# Session 35: The Three-Hour Tour

## 29 Flocktime

The morning of the 29th of Flocktime found the expedition party on _The Screaming Otter_, a river barge, headed toward the sea.
Yenna, Guy, Sorven, Fave, Edgar, Vaelyn, Rayna, and Del, plus all their gear and goods, crowded onto the deck while the captain politely but gruffly repeated her request that no one touch anything.
Partly to keep busy, and partly our of nervous energy, the group bickered and haggled about the distribution of gear between bags and those who could take the load.
Arc had generously purchased a large pile of extra supplies, which took some time to divvy up.

The schedule for the expedition was the hot topic of conversation.
Tonight's high tide would begin the journey, with an arrival in Vasiliki a week later, on the 5th of Wealsun.
The return voyage was scheduled to leave that same port on the 29th of Wealsun, with or without the party.

Despite its clean appearance on maps, the mouth of the Blackwater was not all sharp edges and defined coasts.
Instead, the riverbank gradually spread out into a marshy flat, with deep water only barely distinguishable from shallow tide pools.
The captain's experienced hands worked the barge back and forth across the water until the shoals receded, and the group found themselves in a wide bay, with several large ships at anchor.
The remnants of the tower of Wayland's Watch could be seen in the distance.

## _The Albatross_

Approaching the _Albatross_, her crew was busy using a pair of large cranes fore and aft to load cargo from supply ships.
The _Screaming Otter_ queued up to disburse her passengers, who made it onto the larger vessel without incident.
One small exception was Fave, who lost his breakfast several times between the two decks.
Guy seemed a little pale, always keeping one hand on a railing, but kept his food down.

As they gained the deck, Allysandra, "Ally", introduced herself as the first mate of the ship.
She welcomed everyone aboard with genuine hospitality, and extended an invitation to move freely about the vessel, barring a few locked doors marked as crew-only.
She pointed out the captain of the _Albatross_, Kordova.
He was a tall, broad shouldered, intimidating looking man with piercing blue-gray eyes.
He kept his long hair in dreadlocks, and could be instantly seen anywhere on deck thanks to his well-maintained coat dyed a bright crimson, and the glint off the impeccably-polished basket-hilted sabre.
Pointing to each in turn, she listed the officers: Zamir, Master at Arms (human), Colvin, the healer (halfling), Scrimshaw, the bo'sun (half-orc), Ophivial, sailmistress (half-elf), and Hawk, carpenter.

Del lowered his voice below the din to ask Ally about the ship's policies on and attitudes toward magic.
He explained that several members of the party had some arcane talent, but wondered if the crew would react poorly to it.
Ally again pointed to Colvin, saying he'd likely appreciate any help offered with healing magics, and to Ophivial, whose talents were more specialized.
Colvin, noticing her attention, walked over and caught up with the conversation.

> Don't set anyone on fire and you won't get any steel in your gullet.
> Beyond that, we don't pay attention to the Church hogwash.
> Magic is a tool just like any other.

Del, in an uncharacteristically good mood and extraverted disposition, introduced himself to Ophivial, giving the same offer of help as necessary.
Unlike Colvin, Ophivial seemed less optimistic about the offer, even after Del explained he had some talent specifically with water magics.

> Thank you, but let's hope I don't need your help.
> If I do, things have gone very, very badly.

She excused herself to go help with the launch.
Weighing the anchor and raising the sails, the ship set out to sea.

The evening mess was a fresh lamb stew made by Sid, the cook, enjoyed by everyone but with some hesitation by Fave and Guy.
After, everyone picked out rooms for the night.
The cabins were barely large enough to hold a diagonally-wedged hammock, sometimes two, but they offered at least the illusion of some privacy.

## 30 Flocktime

The morning found the ship at a noticeable roll on the white-capped waves, beneath an overcast sky.
A strong breeze had the crew in good spirits, as they were making good time.
To the passengers eyes, the crew seemed skilled and well-organized, with painless watch rotations, and little to no confusion at any time.

Fave, in an attempt to force his body to deal with his seasickness head-on, climbed up the mast rigging to sit in the crow's nest beside one of the crew.
An occasional disembodied and nonproductive retching from above could be heard across the deck.
He eventually gave up and made his way down to the foredeck, engaging one of the watch in idle chit-chat.
This was well-received, at least until a commanding voice yelled out to get eyes back on the horizon.

Edgar spent the day exploring the ship, making note of each of the off-limits areas.
Approaching the map room on the stern of the poop deck, he found that nearby crew redirected him, explaining that the room wasn't explicitly locked, but that entry presumed some authorized need.
Each time, it was pointed out that maps were crucial to their survival, possibly the most valuable things on the ship, and not children's toys.

The very fact that he was denied access made him want to enter all the more.
Acquiescing and returning to his bunk, he went invisible and returned to the deck.
Making his way across the poop deck to the door, he kept a watchful eye on Kordova and Zamir, who were scanning the horizon from the wheel.

As he opened the door, the loud jangle of a bell sounded from above his head.
A half-breath later found a very large knife sunk into the wood of the door, inches from his face.
The slow and steady footsteps coming toward him were accompanied by Kordova's deep voice:

> I don't know where you are, but you just took your life into your own hands.
> Do it again, and you're walking home.

Zamir's tone was lighter, but no less serious:

> If you're smart, you're gone.

Edgar, not willing to push his already poor luck, skittered back down the stairs and vanished below deck.

Del, hearing about this encounter, stuffed his tome of fire magic into his bag, and went to find Hawk.
Asking the carpenter to scrounge up a small, empty barrel, he returned to his bunk and cast the appropriate spells to fill it with clean, pure water.
Through the rest of the day and into the evening, his quarters emitted bursts of sloshing sounds, gasps for air, and arcane chanting and flashes of light, as he attempted to teach himself how to breathe underwater.
After dinner, a nice potato and spring onion soup, he was joined in this by Vaelyn and Rayna who scrounged up their own barrel.

## 1 Wealsun

The next day found another good breeze, but the sky and seas were much calmer.
This had the crew uneasy, as they believed the shift in weather to be unnatural.
Kordova seemed especially on edge.

The cloudless blue sky and murmurs of concern brought most of the passengers up to the foredeck.
Edgar broke out the spyglass and scanned the horizon alongside the crew on watch.
Del, Vaelyn, and Rayna, seated and legs crossed around their rundlets, continued to submerge their faces, today with far less gasping and surprise.

> Sail ho!

The cry from the crow's nest sent the crew into a flurry of action.
At the same time, Edgar passed the spyglass to Del.

> Look at that ship.
> It has an aura.

Not waiting for an answer, he ran aft to the wheel, getting the attention of Kordova and Zamir.
He relayed what he saw, drawing an unsurprised frown from the latter.

> I told you they were not using the same wind.

Del, looking through the glass, immediately saw what Edgar was referring to.
As he watched, a second ship slid from behind the first.
Muttering to Vaelyn and Rayna, he explained that both of the other ships had powerful spells to direct and reinforce the wind in their favor.
It wasn't a spell he knew, but being that large it was easy to pick apart its elements.
It was harder to get a sense of from this angle, but he also saw what might have been some kind of water magic working in tandem.
He handed off the spyglass to her, before dumping out their barrels and running them down to their hammocks to secure them.
Fave was two steps ahead of him, running to find Yenna, Guy, and Sorven.

As the ships approached, their blue and white sails became apparent.
Edgar offered up any assistance the party could provide, including magics if necessary.
Kordova seemed consigned to fate.

> There are no preparations to be made.
> We can't outrun them.
> If it comes to a fight, we are sunk.
> Come about toward them.

The larger of the blue-gray ships was roughly the same size as the _Albatross_, while the other seemed to be smaller and faster.
Vaelyn pointed out the colors were those of Shalimar.
As the gap closed, Kordova gave the order to furl the sails and stand down.

From the vantage of the crow's nest, Fave was able to make out the large and prominent ballistas lining the decks of the ships.
The conspicuous amounts of blue, gray, and white fletching marked the elves scattered about the foredeck as archers.

Del pulled Ally aside to ask what the posture of the group should be â€” ready to fight, out of view, or something else?
Thin-lipped, Ally asked that they do their best to be out of the way, but to be ready to fight if called.
She commented on the unpredictable nature of the Shalimar, and spoke briefly to rising tensions between Mallium and Plamar.
Zamir stepped over, seeing the conversation, and gave a more direct order:

> For now, gather your party in the mess, and ready your weapons.

The mess quickly became crowded with both passengers and crew, the latter of whom had gathered polearms and spears.
Only a handful of officers stayed on the main deck as the ship slowed to a drift before dropping anchor.

Fave, wandering about and being curious, and Edgar, now invisible and staying out of the way on deck, were able to overhear snippets of Kordova's heated conversation with one of the elves.
What he caught seemed to focus on Mallium, Belorum, and something about "greedy dwarves" hoarding the riches of the sea.
When the topic shifted to Plamar, the other voice turned to acid, accusing them of choosing the wrong side.
Kordova tried to stay neutral and assuage the anger of the other person, repeating that his ship had no contraband, and was not in service for any of those nations.

Despite his attempts, the discussion continued to degrade over its ten-minute length.
Just as it seemed about to come to a head, a loud elf voice rang out from the larger ship.
This immediately deflated the tension, as it seemed the elves suddenly had more pressing concerns.
As the elves withdrew to their ship and began to make sail, the representative addressed Kordova:

> This is either a very lucky day for you, or a very unlucky day for you.
> Either way, we will be back shortly.

A massive fog bank became visible on the horizon, rolling toward the ship.
As the elves moved away, Scrimshaw called all hands to deck, with Ophivial making herself visible against the railing of the foredeck.

> You know what to do!

Intoning a deep drone which seemed to cut through the noise of waves and wood, she twisted her arms and hands about in an arcane rhythm.
Even as the crew ran about their duties, they built on her foundation and began chanting a song which amplified her spell.
Vaelyn and Rayna were able to pick up the words and tones easily enough, and joined in.
At the same time, a strong, cool wind picked up, carrying the ship to the south.

With some distance between the ships, Ophivial shifted her drone to something new, which was picked up instantly by the singing crew.
The deck shuddered and picked up even more speed.
The wind had not changed, but now the sea itself seemed to race in a southerly direction.
Del, studying the interactions of the sailmistress, crew, and weather, was intrigued by the clever ceremonial magic.

## Battle at Sea

Out of the fog bank, a huge, squarish ship appeared.
It was aggressive-looking, with metal plating on the sides, quickly flanked by two smaller ships.
One of the new ships had large paddle-wheels to aid in moving even without the wind.
They all headed straight for the Shalimar ships, the gap closing with frightening speed.

Large balls of dirty flame and lava launched toward the elven ships.
Even at the increasing distance, a chant could be heard coming from the elven crew.
Large green tentacles rose up from the water to ensnare the dwarven ship, beating at the hull plating, trying to find weak spots and capsize it.

The smaller dwarven ship had a long metal spike on the bow, and seemed to be the fastest and most maneuverable.
It raced toward the larger elven ship, piercing it in what looked like some kind of boarding action.
The elven archers and ballistas made quick work of the attackers, felling everyone on the smaller ship.
The scales remained in balance, however, as a fireball took out the smaller elven ship with a single hit.

The large dwarven ship succumbed to the wrath of the tentacles, sinking slowly beneath the waves.
The lead elven ship, listing and low in the water, continued to fire on the dwarven paddle-wheeled ship as it fled to the north.
Before the smaller ship could get far, something unseen sped toward it beneath the water.
Jets of flame lanced out at the incoming wave, but it wasn't enough.
Again, green tentacles rose up and made short work of dragging the ship to the depths.

Kordova's voice rang clear over the chanting crew:

> We've got to get clear before the beast comes for us.
> We need more speed!

Ophivial, grim, said she'd do what she could, and turned to the crew.

> Sing more, sing louder!
> Sing for your lives!

Del, chalk in hand, began scrawling arcane symbols on the deck, squinting at the unseen energies woven by the sailmistress.
Making a few test attempts to gauge the magnitude of the effort, he began a spell of his own to bolster the ceremonial magics.
In his concentration, he hadn't noticed that the leviathan's wake had already caught up with them, green tentacles rising past the railings on both sides of the ship.
