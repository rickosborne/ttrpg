# Session 3: Into the Sept

## The Party

Gus joined the party!
Gus is playing Prur, the Dwarf cleric/monk, on a quest for enlightenment.
Prur has some unique scarring: a hammer from nose to hairline.

## Summary

Brorvec waited in Northunder for Prur, who showed up about an hour after the rest of the party.
They made good time on the road, and managed to show up at the scene of the fight shortly after its conclusion.
Prur spendt some time healing Yen, and then Del and Arc, before settling down and meditating.
Sorven patrolled the area while Arc looted the dead bodies, finding nothing of value.
The remainder of the party rested for a bit while Prur conjured up some food.

Edgar investigated the central dais and found an inscription:

> Buried and sealed below, unliving and unsanctified, forced to slumber by might, mana, and miracles, let the end days see them yet undisturbed.

Several party members were curious about the dais and put effort into moving its very heavy capstone.
Edgar convinced Yen and Brorvec to lower him into the hole exposed beneath, which was a sheer drop of approximately 40 feet.
He climbed back out of the hole after a short pause, and reported seeing an intersection branching in 4 directions.

Del cast a spell to set off an alarm at the approach of anything hostile, and the rest of the party rotated through turns at watch and sleep.
The night was cold and frosty, but passed without event.

In the morning the party made their way one at a time down into the hole.
Most made it down without injury, though Sorven and Prur each lost their grips on the rope.
Del was able to catch Prur with magic, but not Sorven, who took a heavy blow.
While doing so, Del noticed that the magic in this area favored necromancy and gate magics, impairing healing and protection.

The initial room didn't have anything interesting, so the party headed off in a direction that Yen recognized as northerly.
A bit down the hallway the party came across two large statues which Del recognized as being demonic in nature.
Further down the hall, writing on the wall said "Honored Craftsmen".

Curiosity getting the best of him, Brorvec rounded a corner to find a group of snarling, scraping undead _somethings_ charging at him.
The monsters came from both directions, getting into close combat and grappling everyone they could see.
The party retreated step by step, back the way they came, but the monsters kept coming.

As the session ended, the monsters were still coming, with not a single one yet knocked down.

## Outcomes

No XP this week â€” we'll get it for both weeks at the end of the next session.
