# Session 32: Guy, Interrupted

Samdi, the 21st of Flocktime, was a slow day for most.
Edgar once again tried to track down Nelora.
Her shop was open this time, but attended by a teen boy with an attitude.
Not wanting to strike up a conversation, Edgar left without introducing himself.

Lounging around the common area, Yenna found she couldn't shake the mental image of a magic cave bear.
Remembering how Gavin had said something about his daughter becoming quite the naturalist, she pestered Gerin with unending questions.

Gerin allowed that the entirety of her knowledge of cave bears came from books, and not entirely reputable ones.
It seemed the species was native to the lands of Formorria to the northeast.
Yenna was familiar with the area, though it was farther north than she'd ever been.
The land was crawling with giants, and puny humans were not considered welcome.

Gerin pointed out that cave bears were also larger than those you'd find in a forest.
Roughly half again as large, they made formidable foes.
Entranced by this, Yenna spent hours quizzing Gerin on every detail, encouraging her to go back through books and find illustrations.

As delightful as it was to see Yenna so engaged, Guy eventually grew bored.
Wandering back to the Cock & Balls, he spent several hours drinking and chatting up the locals.
It was a slow night, but the jasmine mead was good enough to make up for the poor harmonization of the few other patrons willing to join him in song.
Several hours and Talents later, he came home without learning anything new.

For the first time since the group had met Gavin, the entire day and night passed without incident.

## The Morning

Just after breakfast on Fellodi, 22nd Flocktime, found Gavin once again calling everyone together in the common area.
He'd made arrangements for the expedition to find the _Cantwell_, and hopefully find the ley rods.
Before he had a chance to provide details, Vaelyn stepped forward holding a palm-sized medallion.

> It has become clear the Order is aware of who we are, where we are, and what we seek.

Sorven pulls out a similar ornament, showing it to the others.
Vaelyn suggests they check for magic or scrying before they continue the conversation.
Nodding, Sorven crossed the room to her, and the pair stepped away in a flurry of whispers.

Gavin continues:

> What you don't know is that the Order is not a monolithic organization.
> Especially at the higher ranks, it's a loose association of powerful mages whose interests are only sometimes aligned.

He suggests the mages check the medallions for enchantments.
Del offers to help, though he cautions that it is an excruciatingly slow process — a full read can take hours.
If the enchantments were created by sufficiently advanced mages, he warned he might not be able to get anything from them.

Vaelyn wondered aloud if each medallion would have enchantments targeting its recipient.
If so, they'd need to spend the time on each item in turn, potentially taking days.
Yenna suggested they just throw the items into the river.
No one was entirely certain whether she was joking.

Fave signed to Edgar that he was running out to the leatherworks to pick up his repaired armor, slipping out the door.
Gavin, sensing a lull in the conversation as Del and Vaelyn walked off to quiet rooms for the rituals, continued detailing his plans.
The party was booked on a ship, the _Albatross_, which would set sail on the 29th — a week from the day.

Guy shifted uneasily in his chair.
He explained that one of the tidbits he'd heard the night before at the Cock & Balls was about a group of Strig.
These mercenaries had been working for Ed the Red, on behalf of the Lady, and hadn't heard that both were dead.
Guy didn't like the idea of giving the group another entire week to track them down.

Nick, the errand boy who was until that point quiet in a corner, jumped up and ran out of the room.
Returning at a run, he panted as he handed guy a swatch of hide.
The leather had some kind of symbol painted on it, which Guy seemed to recognize.

> A messenger left this for you.
> He said a friend of yours is waiting to talk to you, across the street.

Seeing Guy taken aback, Edgar and Yenna stood immediately to accompany their friend.
As Edgar vanished, Guy showed the painted mark to the group, along with a large burn on his forearm.

> It's the symbol of my clan.
> The last time I saw it, it was being burned off my arm as I was being banished.

This caused Fave and Brorvec to also rise, cracking their knuckles in unison.
Everyone made their way to windows, to see if they could spot any stand-out Strig.
There's only one: on the other side of Old Bridge Road, in the southwest corner.
The person was concealed by a large cloak, making it impossible to gather any details.

Fave, fully kitted out in his new armor, offered to make his way out the front door, while the others approached from the side.
The disembodied voice of Edgar let everyone know he'd keep an eye on the young monk.
Reaching the small dining area of a nearby establishment, Fave took an outdoor table which afforded him a view of any activity.

Brorvec scowled as Yenna and Guy threw on their leather armor.
He didn't have any armor which wouldn't draw attention, so he was going to have to go out in street wear.
Determined not to leave the house naked, he strapped a small sledgehammer to his belt.

## The Challenge

As the trio came walking up the street, they saw Fave bolt upright and run toward the river, out of view.
Not wanting to give anything away, they kept walking.
Brorvec looked up to see Vaelyn in the window as they passed, hooking a finger toward his ear.
She didn't seem to notice their passage or his signal.
A whisper comes from nowhere:

> Fave's heading toward a guy around the corner, with a maul and shield.
> The hooded guy has a greatsword under his cloak.
> There's a third in the alley with dual scimitars.
> I haven't seen the fourth yet.

Guy cursed.
He began to explain that he'd been running from this group ever since he'd been exiled, but was cut off by a roar from across the street.

> Guimundur! It's time to pay!

The hooded figure threw off his cloak, unsheathing the large weapon and flourishing it.
Yenna hissed a "we're not armed", and both she and Brorvec began to drag Guy toward the front door of the Skeleton Key.
The trio broke into a run as Edgar's disembodied voice rang out for guards.
Moments later, a watch bell across the street began to toll without anyone near it.

Making the door, Guy wrenched it open and barreled inside.
The other two followed, with Guy slamming it closed after Brorvec.
Guy put his back to the door, yelling at the other two:

> Get Gavin downstairs!

The shield-bearing Strig slammed into the door at speed.
Its hinges buckled, several screws popping loose of the frame, but it held.
Brorvec put his shoulder to Guy's hip, trying to help the larger man brace with his bulk.
He yelled to Yenna as she sprinted up the stairs:

> Grab my axe and shield!

A second cracking thud rang out.
The crossbeams of the door gave way, causing large slats to fall free.
The second Strig could be seen on the other side, drawing back his large maul.
Arc, seeing this from his room on the third floor, began to concentrate on restraining the large man.

## The Distraction

Along the river, Fave caught up with the Strig he'd been running down.
The man didn't see him coming, taking the full weight of a flying kick to the base of his spine.
Staggering against the flaming hay cart he was pushing, the larger man didn't fall.

The Strig didn't seem overly impressed.
Ignoring the young monk, he went back to the pushing his cart, picking up speed.

Fave landed a second kick, this one aimed more precisely.
Winded, the larger man put all his weight into the cart, pushing it up the hill toward the guard tower.
Using his momentum, Fave spun and landed a pair of heel strikes against one of the cart's two large wheels.
Its steel-bound rim dented, but stayed intact.

The Strig pulled himself up to his full height, pulling out a shield and lethal-looking curved sword.
Fave smiled as the two began to circle each other.

Lashing out with a pair of blows, the monk got an elbow past a too-slow shield.
The follow-up punch wasn't as well-timed, and the curved blade caught the monk's arm just below the elbow.
Steel went through flesh and bone, dropping the appendage to the street.

Feinting for Faves other arm, the Strig didn't regain his balance in time to land the follow-up blow.
Fave countered with a powerful spin kick, knocking the man several steps back.
Stepping forward, the larger man's shield blocked a heel strike.

Again, the young monk pressed the attack too far.
A third kick went wide, and the larger man's curved blade sliced into it as it passed.
This time the steel came back clean, unable to get through the layers of armor.
Fave kicked away another swing with enough force to elicit a grunt from the man.

Going for a spinning punch, the monk found his other arm again parried by steel.
As before, the edge went through flesh and bone, though not as completely.
Nonfunctional, the limb dangled loosely from his shoulder.

## The Chaos

The hooded Strig stared at the self-ringing bell.
Unamused, he slashed out with his greatsword at the rope above it.
Though the rope was quite old, it held well enough to keep the bell from dropping.
The second swing did it in, clattering the bell to the street.

Edgar, not wanting to tangle with a man twice his side, stepped back quietly.
Pulling his sling from his belt, he selected a caltrop and fitted it into place.
Aiming for the other man's arm, he snapped the sling, digging the projectile into a heavy leather bracer.
The man looked around and cursed in something guttural Edgar couldn't understand, before crossing the street toward the Skeleton Key.

The Strig with the maul landed a second blow, liberating any remaining parts of the door.

Inside, Yenna gained the second floor, beelining for Guy's room.
Grabbing his glaive and axe, she yelled a warning to everyone on the level.
As she passed Sorven at the head of the stairs, he blurred and dropped into the form of Lamikel.
In the farthest room, she heard Del's voice begin to chant, thick frost vapors forming in the doorway.

Brorvec and Guy raced up the stairs, pushing past the tiger.
Yenna handed off Guy's weapons before darting off again toward her room.
Brorvec kept going, running toward his own room.
One by one, the rest of the party gathered at the choke point.

Vaelyn, catching the eyes of those around her, mimed a wall forming in place just in front of Lamikel.
It seemed that most understood her, as several people took a step back to give her space to cast.
