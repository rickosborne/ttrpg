# Session 28: Team "Hold My Beer"

At Sorven's suggestion, Del took control of the enchanted glass eye and guided it back to the oubliette.
The eye floated unnoticed past the Lady as she checked over her handiwork with the spears.
Through the warped perspective of the artifact, Del was able to see Gerin, chained to the large grate in the drainage sump.
As he moved to return the eye, however, the Lady caught sight of it.
With a wave of her hand, Del's connection to the eye was broken, and the element of surprise lost.

While the party stood around and tried to figure out next steps, Fave got impatient and started to pull himself up through the hole.
Guy did his best to slow the monk down, before shrugging and letting him go.
Del, tapping Guy on the shoulder, released a spell and said:

> Follow him, and use some of that chalk of yours to mark the traps above.

Guy didn't understand for a moment, but as the spell took hold and the magic around them began to reveal itself, he nodded and followed.
One by one, everyone made their way up into the passage.

Sorven an Edgar stepped up to the south wall, the mage speaking an incantation the younger man had not yet heard.
With a firm push, the older man sent the other flying into the wall, which seemed to bubble and warp like quicksand to accept him.
The glowing powerstone in the mage's hand began to curse loudly in Callach as the second spell washed over the elder, and he, too, stepped into the stone wall. 

The two Strig moved cautiously along the tunnel as the eye, now under the Lady's control, zipped fleetingly back into the dark.
Guy, a finger to one temple and a hunk of chalk in his grasp, tried to interpret what his expanded senses were telling him.
Yenna had a torch in one hand, and was tapping against the stone flooring.
A slab she'd just checked flared into incandescent flames as she stepped on it.
Frustrated and more perturbed than hurt, she pulled her foot free of the spell and stepped out of the fire.

Shrugging toward Guy, she pointed at the half elves and made an up-and-over motion with her thumb.
One at a time, Vaelyn and Rayna stepped back, sprinted, and cleared the fire, the tall Strig woman cushioning their landings.
Del, following, didn't bother to jump.
Instead, one moment he was striding toward the fire, the next he was yards past it without crossing the length between.

Fave, indifferent to it all, walked confidently around the corner.
Peeking his head back around, he whistled to get Del's attention, pointing at the torch in Yenna's hand.
The mage made a swinging motion with his staff, a glow detaching from the stone at the end, lighting the way for the younger man.
Now able to see the far end, which he knew was illusory, he sprinted at it.
Bounding up and off the wall, he got as much air as he could.

It wasn't enough.
His right leg caught the line of spears, two heads ripping through his flesh, and breaking off from the momentum.
The man went down in a heap, slapping against the stone of the tunnel.

## In the Oubliette

Edgar emerged from the stone wall, already invisible, assessing the situation.
The Lady noticed him immediately, staring him dead in the eyes:

> Hello.

Her next words were in a language Edgar didn't understand, and were accompanied by the hand movements of some kind of spell.
A bright blue flame started at her head and drizzled quickly down her body, engulfing her form entirely.
Without a hesitation, the young man leapt toward her, staves flying.
The first blow glanced off, while she caught the second squarely on an uplifted arm.

Edgar felt like he'd a stone wall.
Worse, as the staff found its mark, the blue flames around her ran up his weapon and along his arm, causing his leather armor to crack and burn.
A second pair of attacks had the same result, a miss, an ineffective hit, and flames streaking down his other arm.

Sorven, his face alone protruding momentarily from the wall, took this in with a cold gaze.
His arm held back in the stone, he began a second spell to form a projectile at the end of his staff.
Waiting until Edgar took a step back, he mirrored the motion and stepped forward, releasing the missile with a hiss.

The Lady was unmoved, barely acknowledging the attack.
When the stone ball got within a hand's breadth of her, it reversed course without losing momentum, zipping back at its caster.
Caught off guard by this, the powerstone in his hand again cursed loudly as he spun and ducked back into the wall.

Re-emerging from the stone, he watched the Lady calmly blocked blow after blow with her bare arms.
He knew the spell she was using, and he knew the lad's attacks would come to nothing as long as she could fend them off.
This realization inspired him.
Again stepping forward, he reached his staff as far as he could toward her, and released a writhing confusion of arcane energies at her.
She spun in place, putting her back to Edgar, who used the opportunity to land a blow to her skull.

As flames continued to race down the arms of the younger man, the older man grew concerned.
He tossed a quick heal in the direction of his friend, but found the magic splinter and fizzle before it arrived.

## Pile Up

Fave struggled to get to his feet as the others approached.
Before anyone could reach him, he was once again off down the hall.

Vaelyn whispered to Rayna, who nodded and flattened her back against a wall.
She, Yenna, and Guy walked to the spear wall and began pulling them quickly from the floor.
Del stepped up behind them, held out his arms, and said:

> Load me up.

They caught on quickly, dropping spear after spear onto the mage's pile.
Four in hand, and an opening wide enough to pass, the mage took one long stride and again was several yards down the hall without crossing the space between.

Vaelyn followed behind him, forgetting the warnings about the traps.
To Del's momentary surprise, nothing happened as she crossed the stoned he knew had been trapped before.
Guy and Yenna stepped into the hall, drawing their weapons, but were wary about the curse they were told awaited them.

Del, arriving at Fave's position, saw that the glowing energy barrier was once again in place, and Edgar had driven the Lady, still aflame, back against it.
Tapping Fave on the shoulder blade, the mage released a pulse that should have ended with the younger man on the other side of the barrier.
Nothing happened.
Cursing, Del looked closer at the barrier and realized his mistake â€” the ward wasn't just physical, it also shredded any spell sent through it.

A bright glow caught the attention of all.
The Lady had rolled back her head and released a gout of bright blue flame from her too-wide mouth.
Surprised, Edgar caught it square in the chest, where it splashed like water and crawled up his neck and down his legs.
This caused his next attack to falter, the staff slipping in his grasp, to an awkward mid-length position.

## Outcomes

* Del spent 1 XP to re-roll a _Blink Other_
* Edgar spent 1 XP to re-roll a defense, then 3 XP for an attack re-roll
* Fave spent 1 XP on a re-roll for the spears
* Sorven spent 1 XP for a re-roll
