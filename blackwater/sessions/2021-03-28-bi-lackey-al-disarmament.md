# Session 30: Bi-lackey-al Disarmament

Guy held the tip of his glaive close enough to shave the closest interloper:

> No funny business.

Over his shoulder, he tossed a casual question:

> Are we keeping any of them alive?

Steps away, Fave's wounds were beginning to hit him.
He threw everything he had at the man in front of him, but fewer landed than hit.
Those which did hit seemed to cause small, colorful bursts of misty energy.
The missed attacks brought on parries which sliced into his bare skin, slowing him further.
One particularly unfortunate flying kick ended with the young monk flat on his back, panting, his target running off into the darkness.

Not hearing an answer, Guy sank his blade into the woman.
She sank to the floor, the red pool radiating out from her almost black in the dim light.

With a heavy pounding on the stone floor and an erratic spray of light across the walls, Yenna sped past everyone into the next hall.
Her long strides found her alongside the fleeing woman, just as the halfling disappeared around the far corner.
Pouring it on, she was just yards away as the man dropped through the hole to the sewer below.
Recognizing she was getting far from the group, she skidded to a stop, just as the woman caught up.

Reaching out a large arm toward the woman, she managed to secure a shoulder pad, hooking fingers into the collar.
The woman was quick to lash out with a saber, but a heavy jerk threw her off balance enough to allow Yenna to bat away her arm.
With a growl, the larger woman picked the smaller off her feet before throwing her to the floor.

Behind them, Fave came running around the corner.
His face was pale from blood loss and sweaty from effort.
Without stopping, he hopped into a pair of stomp-kicks toward the woman.
The first connected, but the second was too slow from the exertion — the woman's saber batted his heel aside, carving a deep gash across his calf.
He wavered, dazed, before collapsing to the ground.

Again the saber arced, this time toward Yenna, but the glowing headband too high above distracted her just enough for the slice to go wide.
Unbelievably fast, the Strig woman had an axe in her free hand, slashing it across the retreating weapon arm.
The blow caught her across the straps holding on her bracers, opening a gash from elbow to wrist.
Sword clattering to the ground, the woman screamed and kicked back against the wall.

Pointing her axe at the woman, Yenna warned her coldly:

> Stay down.

One of the other intruders came at her from behind with another saber.
Again, the dazzle from the headband as she whipped her head around was enough to cause the strike to go wide.
The man's eyes went wide in panic.
He mumbled out a heavily-accented cacophony of syllables as he ran past her:

> No fight Strig!

Within a blink, he disappeared down the hole.

More running footfalls alerted Yenna to the approach of the remaining attacker.
Her hand pulled her second axe free as she turned to face him.
He slid to a stop in front of her, using his momentum to bring the head of his two-handed mace along a wide path.
Not giving him time to complete the maneuver, she raised her right axe dramatically, while snapping out with a brutal strike with her left.

He saw the first, ducking to one side, but missed the second completely.
The blade sliced cleanly through flesh and bone above his right elbow, dropping the severed appendage to the floor.
His weapon clattered to the floor as he stared in horror, unable to comprehend what had just happened, sinking to his knees.
Looking back to the woman, Yenna snarled at her:

> That could have been you.

Del worked his way toward the commotion, leaning heavily on his staff, free hand steadying himself against the wall.
Glancing over his shoulder, Guy's head snapped back in a double take.
He blinked repeatedly, as if trying to clear his eyes.
Del knew the look — one unused to seeing what a mage sees — and smirked as he hobbled past the larger man.

> You alright, Del?

The mage blew off the question:

> I'm exhausted — this is how it always is.

Reaching out a large hand as he caught up in a single stride, Guy pressed the question:

> Are you sure, man?

It was enough to finally catch the mage's attention.
Not wanting to lose momentum, he beckoned the Strig to follow:

> Walk and talk — what do you see?

Guy struggled to describe what he was seeing.
Some kind of glowing mist surrounded Del, Edgar, and Sorven.
It had been there a while — at least since they started fighting the Lady, maybe longer.
Vaelyn, catching up with them, asked if she was also affected.
Guy squinted, bobbing his head up and down, but didn't think so.

Rounding the corner, the trio came upon a grisly scene.
Yenna stood, looming over a pair of interlopers, each cradling wounds and pressed against opposite walls.
Fave lay unconscious in a heap, multiple open lacerations across his thighs and calves.
Vaelyn knelt and shouted a prayer in Mellinarathi before laying hands on him, closing his wounds.
He sat up as she sank to the ground, exhausted.

Del crossed to the man with the missing arm, shouted the same prayer, and jabbed him in the ribs with his staff.
The stream of bright red pouring out from between the man's fingers slowed to a trickle.
The man came out of his daze with a gasp, staring in confusion at the mage.

Del ignored him, moving back to the far wall before slumping against it, exhausted muscles shaking and twitching as the crisis abated.
He looked up to see Yenna coming down, as well, recognizing their shared disdain for so much bloodshed.
Wanting to keep the focus off her, he addressed their captives through gritted teeth as the rest of the party joined them:

> You know you just took money to kill a child, right?

The pair looked at Rayna, but neither seemed affected by the statement.
Sorven pressed, asking who hired them.
The man replied:

> We just work for Yames, we do that he says.

Sorven continued the dialogue:

> How much are you getting paid?

The woman hissed at the man to stay quiet.
Sorven reached forward and released a spell, tapping the man on his forehead.
The man's bleeding again slowed, and his breathing slowed from its panicked hyperventilation.
Sorven asked the man's name.

> Carl.  We were supposed to get 100 Farthings each.

Fave, looking around and seeing all the mages exhausted, decided he was on his own to mend his arm.
The crossbow bolt was wedged between the bones in his forearm, with a head just large enough to make pulling it back out impossible.
Instead, he ripped the fletching off, then dragged the bare shaft out along its path, nearly passing out again from the effort.

The woman continued to try to get her companion to be quiet.
Fave walked over to her, looking like he was going to knock her unconscious.
Instead, his fingers jabbed out in a blurry series of blunt thrusts into what seemed like random joints and muscle groups.
Instead of drawing blood or even bruising her, her eyes drooped and shoulders slumped, any energy for resistance ebbing out of her.

His job complete, Fave wandered off back down the hall, and could be heard dragging the corpses into a pile.
Guy and Yenna followed, letting Edgar and Sorven keep an eye on the now-docile captives.

Sorven continue his line of questions: how many more were there, where could Yames be found, and on.

> He's normally in the warehouse up the street.
> But he won't be there now.
> He'll be out of Blackwater within the hour, with Billy, the other one.
> You won't see them again.

Sorven nodded, happy with this answer.
Leaning against the wall, he picked up the severed limb from the floor.
Taking some chalk from his pocket, he drew a series of runes and circles around the man, intoning a slow chant.

Without any warning, he swatted away the remaining hand of the man before jamming the arm back into place and releasing his spell.
A flash of ghostly gray light pulsed from the wound.
When the old man pulled back, the arm remained, color flooding back into it.

The man winced as he tried to work the limb.
It responded in twitches and jumps, but he seemed to have some measure of capability.
His gaze jumped back and forth between it and the old man in front of him, who looked like he was about to fall over from the effort.

> Why ... why would you do that?

**TODO: Conversation with Edgar**

After taking several minutes to catch his breath, Sorven began walking around, trying to heal people.
The woman was first, the flesh of her arm stitching together before her eyes.
Edgar was next, both men expecting the same effect.

As the spell released, it fizzled, refusing to connect with its target.
From across the hall, Del muttered a curse.
Getting to his feet, he pointed to a stone on the ground, and told Edgar to stand on it without moving.
Like Sorven had done, Del drew out a geometric series of shapes and sigils with a bit of chalk, pacing and chanting, looking the other man up and down.

> You're cursed.
> I'm not familiar with the spell, but it looks like it diffuses healing magic.
> It's probably on all of us.

Clicking his tongue, Sorven walked up and clapped another heal into Edgar's forehead.
This one went through, burned skin uncurling and rejoining.
Del, still squinting and reading, sucked air through his teeth.

> I think that weakened it.
> That might be the only way to get rid of it: bruise and heal him repeatedly until the curse burns away.

Edgar nodded at first, before the latter half of the mage's statement hit home.

> Wait.  What?

The mage had already walked away, and was once again sitting crouched against a wall, hooded cloak pulled down over his features.

The next half hour was a blur of activity.
Enough healing was passed around to close wounds and prevent them from getting infected in the sewers.
Fave and Guy worked to jam as much of the mercenaries' equipment into his large bag as they could.
Much discussion was had about what to do with the corpses, but no one had any good ideas.

Arriving back at the Skeleton Key, Gavin and Gerin had quite the reunion.
Gerin was still in the dark about why any of it had happened, and Gavin was prostrate in his apologies about his business concerns putting her life in danger.

Turning to the party, his gratitude flowed.
He offered them free rent and access to all his resources for as long as they wanted.
The more exhausted members of the party were dubious about whether his gratitude would survive the dawn, wandering off to their various beds and collapsing.
