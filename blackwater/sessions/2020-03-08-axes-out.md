# Session 5: Axes Out

## The Party

Gus and Gabriel were out for the session, with their characters being run by Daniel and Rick/Lee.

## Summary

Making their way back to the central chamber, the party decided to head to the southern chamber, on the theory that it might be a mirror image of the northern chamber.
They brought up a number of additional lights — torches and spells — and made their way in that direction.

Despite their caution, the party was caught off-guard by an axe that whistled in from the darkness.
Brorvec failed to get his shield up in time and took the full of the blade to his face.
Being a tough dwarf, he stayed on his feet.
Prur rushed over to help him, pulling out the axe and laying on his hands.

Edgar rushed past the downed Brorvec to attack the axe-throwing undead, taking out its knee.
Swinging blindly with two axes in a wide arc, the undead managed to break Edgar's arm and gore him across the groin.
Edgar passed out from the damage, slumping to the floor.
Brorvec, after being healed by Prur, stepped across Edgar's prone form to interpose his shield.

Meanwhile, Yen got caught up in her rage had charged ahead to attack the sword-and-shield-carrying undead on the other side of the chamber.
In her excitement, she fumbled her attacks and left herself open.
Failing to parry a strike from the sword, she took a strong blow to her arm, causing her to drop her axe.
Her arm went numb for the rest of the fight, only magnifying her berserking rage.

Del and Prur were able to get in a few strong blows, but the plate armor on the undead kept them up for quite some time.
Brorvec dropped the first one, followed by Yen dropping the second.
Yen initially failed to overcome her rage, but some quick thinking by her teammates kept her at bay.
Ultimately, Del tricked Yen into thinking that the undead was getting to its feet, and striking it down was enough to bring her to her senses.

A search of the corpses revealed that the undead wore plate armor embossed with the labyrinthine circular symbol of the Black Sun, which Del knew was associated with very old demonic rituals.
The armor looked very old, made of some dark steel or similar metal.
Their weapons were normal throwing axes and a sword, all of which seemed of good balance and make.
The party stripped down the corpses and left the armor and weapons in a pile in the central chamber.

While everyone rested, Arc searched the immediate area, finding another one of the demonic statues.
He also noted that the stone caskets the undead had crawled out of were labeled with the names of the interred: Idris and Enoch.
Edgar's arm didn't look so good — the physicians in the group estimated that it would take several months to heal.

Edgar took an hour to commune with his deity while everyone rested, and learned a little more than what they'd already figured out.
The history of this place included demonic deals and unholy alliances.
It was enough to get the entire sept sealed off by the church.

The southeastern path from the chamber led around a corner to the north, which ended in a drop into an oubliette.
Arc floated down into the pit, finding standing water some 5 yards down.
Yen noticed the sound of rustling and squeaking and asked Del to float his candlelight upwards.
Another 5-10 yards up found the ceiling covered in a number of megabats.
Del moved the light around enough to note that there was a ledge to the south, which was likely the entrance used by the bats.
Worried that the bats were getting increasingly agitated, Del doused the light.

The party again made their way back to the central chamber, then headed into the final hallway to the east.

Edgar led the party, keeping pace with the slow-moving candlelight provided by Del.
A dozen or so yards down the hall, the stone floor shifted and began to drop out from under him.
Jumping to the side, he found a ledge which wasn't moving, landing safely.
The rest of the party saw the floor tip upwards toward them, then back down again as Edgar's weight moved off it.
Following the lines in the stonework, the party shimmied along the wall past the trap.

Arriving at the end of the hallway, the party came upon another stone carving:

    The Guardian secret in his gaze
    His back to the cold north wind, shows the way
    Beyond the shimmer of your rippling face,
    A long wet breath to where she lays
    Keeper of death to the end of days

There was some discussion about the translation of the ancient Callach text, but ultimately Edgar was able to convince everyone that "nippling face" probably wasn't the original author's intent. 

## Outcomes

Everyone got 3 points, taking them up to 177/174.
