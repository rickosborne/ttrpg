# Session 4: The Undead Tide

## The Party

Gus was unavailable, so Prur was run by Daniel for the day.
Matt and Daniel figured out some of the details of Prur's hammer attack.

## Summary

After a run of very bad luck, our heroes found that they couldn't inflict much damage on their undead attackers.
Three undead latched on to Yen and began to strangle her, though they had trouble getting through her leathers and tough skin.
Arc managed to land a few shots, but they didn't seem to have as much impact as he'd hoped.
Del got a few ice spheres in, and though he crushed in several undead, they kept attacking.
In a clutch moment, Sorven was able to lend their energy to Del, to facilitate several more ice spheres.

The party got to see Prur in action for the first time.
With flashes of divine light, the hammer-shaped scar on his forehead erupted to attack the undead.
Unfortunately, most of Prur's attacks missed their targets, only finally landing toward the end of the fight.

Yen managed to land several good kicks, with Brorvec and Edgar landing several shots of their own.
Arc gambled on an attempt to use a skill that was still new to him, and managed to hit Yen instead.
Smashing one undead to the ground, Yen managed to snap out of her berserking rage, much to the visible relief of her friends.
It took some time, but the party was able to eventually down all of the undead. 

Prur was able to heal up the damage to himself, Brorvec, and Yen.
Sorven and Del took their time to recover some lost energy.
 Prur noticed that the undead-inflicted damage was harder to heal than expected, verifying Del's earlier observation about the foul magic in the place.

Edgar and Brorvec searched the crypt, but found nothing of significance.
Similarly, Arc searched the corpses and also came up with not much more than lint.

## Outcomes

Everyone gained 5XP total for the 2 sessions, taking the players to 174/171.
