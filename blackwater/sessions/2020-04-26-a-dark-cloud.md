# Session 12: A Dark Cloud

## The Party

Everyone was present, with no substitutions!

## Summary

Two staircases ran up the sides of the south end of the room.
Down those stairs, stopping half-way, strode a pair of plate-clad skeleton knights.
A skeleton mage stood on the stone ledge connecting the two, gathering arcane energies in its bony hands.

Yenna was the first to action, throwing her chakram with an accompanying growl of ululation, before charging through the door toward the closer of the two knights.
Arc wasn't far behind her, picking up and throwing a pair of stones at second knight.
Sorven and Guy continued the ranged assault, firing off a stone missile and arrow in the same direction.
The mage, seeing this series of projectiles, waved its hands and brought up an inky black cloud around its position.

This gave Yenna the time and cover to close the distance, making huge strides to get up the stairs and into the face of the first knight.
She landed two mighty axe blows through the thick plate which would have driven a mortal to their knees, though the knight seemed unfazed.
Guy followed this up with his own well-aimed shot to the second knight, arrow whizzing past Arc's head to drill itself through the collarbone of the knight.
Brorvec, catching up to Yenna, was able to land a blow against the shin of the first knight before wedging himself between the two.
He gave Yenna a look meant to communicate patience, which was lost to her berserking focus.

The hiss and pops of arcane fire were the only warning of the fireball that came shooting out of the black cloud, straight at the oversized target of Yenna.
Brorvec, ready for anything, was able to raise his shield high enough to take the full blast.
A wave of heat poured past him, followed by the scent of singed hair.

The party heard something from the black cloud they hoped was a curse of frustration.
They knew they were wrong when they again heard the rasping sound of stone against stone.

Edgar vanished as he approached the stairs, ran past the knight
Behind him, Yenna landed another mighty slash, followed by Brorvec's mace to its knee.
Arc landed hits on the second knight with a pair of stones.
The second knight slumped, its weight carrying it down several steps before coming to a rest.

Edgar, having gained the landing, stepped into the cloud and immediately toppled into an open stone coffin.
In the same moment, a pair of skeleton archers emerged from the darkness enveloping the west side of the room, followed by a quartet of shield-bearer skeletons wielding axes and swords.
Arc, sensing a shift in the momentum of the fight, decided to try something unexpected.
He ran back into the antechamber, grabbed the golden mask off the floor, and pressed it to his face.

Del, close to exhaustion from his earlier efforts, knew he wouldn't be much help in his current state.
He made his way along the east wall of the room, making a straight line for the desk in the corner.
With a wave of his staff, the surrounding air solidified into something resembling the wall and desk, hiding him from the view of the archers.
He could be heard muttering about Asturias, getting increasingly frustrated as his search came up empty.
Sorven trailed behind him, building up a large stone boulder at the end of his staff.

Guy, shifting focus to the shield-bearers, loosed another true arrow.
The resulting crunch alerted Arc to how close they'd come to him.
Squealing, he ran back out of the room before reappearing moments later and launching more stones.
The skeleton archers also fired, but Yenna's frenetic movements and Brorvec's shield were enough to keep anyone from harm.
A stray arrow took down Del's illusion, causing him to curse and lose focus on his search.
Avoiding a skeletal swordsman, Del disappeared from his position before reappearing a stride away and making his way down the ladder between the stairs.

The edge of the cloud again spat fire at Yenna.
This time the fire spun in a tornado, wider than even Yenna could spread her arms and moving at a fast running pace toward her.
Focused on the knight, she sneered at the fire as she landed another doubled slice.

The fire tornado threw the rest of the room into chaos.
Guy took an axe to the chest, transfixed by the sight.
Brorvec was able to intervene, saving him from one hit but not a second.
Nor was he able to catch the sword thrust to Sorven's back that crumpled him to the ground.
Yenna, finally distracted by the pair's cries, also took a sword to the kidney.
Adding to the confusion, Edgar appeared in mid-air, just beyond the dark cloud, before falling to the ground.

Yenna managed to finally cause enough damage to the knight to drop it.
She ran back to the group, but the fire tornado was just as fast.
It overtook her, Brorvec, and Sorven's unconscious form, burning at the exposed flesh.
As if a living entity, it seemed to take a breath before doubling its intensity.
Brorvec managed to take the leg out from under a skeleton, before dragging Sorven away from the fire.

The archers fired again from their elevated position, at the same time Del saw something zip through the air into the cloud.
Ready for the arrows, Del was able to return one with a wave of his staff, sending it into the skull of the rear archer.
The second arrow missed Yenna, embedding itself into the shield of the sword-bearing skeleton behind her.
The effort cost Del, dropping him to a knee for a moment.
He smelled something familiar as Edgar, invisible again, sprinted past him before parkouring up the stairs.

Guy, barely keeping himself out of the fire, was able to switch to his polearm and finish off the one-legged skeleton before moving to help Brorvec with Sorven.
Arc followed this with another two solid hits to the shield-bearer approaching Brorvec.
Yenna surveyed the situation, giving her time to dodge an incoming axe before loosing a bellow as the fire again overtook her.
The intensifying fire and a good block from a skeleton caused her to drop her own axe and miss the attack which drove a sword into her chest.

Across the room, a panting Del was out of options except as a distraction.
He took swing after swing with his staff at one of the skeleton archers, allowing Edgar to get into position behind them.
The closest archer released an arrow at Del, who was again able to send it back to its source.

Arc, seeing the party's resolve beginning to flag, jammed an arm into his bag.
When it came out it held a small glass vial filled with a thin red liquid.
