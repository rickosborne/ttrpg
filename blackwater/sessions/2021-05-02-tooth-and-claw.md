# Session 33: Tooth & Claw

The Strig behind a large shield poked his head around the corner, saw the crowd waiting at the top of the stairs, and immediately stepped back out of sight.
Arc concentrated, attempting to rip the shield away, but underestimated the effort.
He felt something stretch and pop, and his vision went white.
A warm trickle of blood bubbled out from his ear.

Lamikel, attracted by the movement, bounded down the stairs, several hundred pounds of teeth and claws landing against his target's shield.
The Strig next to them, wielding the war maul, brought it down toward a spot between the large cat's shoulders.
Backing several steps up the stairs, Lamikel felt the weapon brush his whiskers before digging a hole into the floor.
The man freed it and swung a second time, aiming for the tiger's skull.
Lamikel didn't manage to get out of the way, taking the full brunt of the swing.

Recovering quickly, Lamikel swiped with one claw and followed immediately with a snapping bit to the kidneys.
He held the grapple as the maul again came down toward him.
Guy, seeing the tiger's reduce mobility, managed to get his glaive between the two to deflect the blow.
Vaelyn spoke a word in Mellinarathi, snapping a shimmering wall of force into being on the between the two Strig attackers.

Del stepped to his side, before disappearing in a swirl of frost emanating from the large ice spike floating next to him.
A second swirl followed, and he was at ground level.
He teetered as one foot landed on the dining bench, before finding his balance and turning to make his way back to the stairs.

Releasing his hold on the man's torso, Lamikel again feinted with a swipe before chomping down on the other kidney.
Guy pushed forward with a stab, but couldn't connect.
The greatsword-wielding leader pounded against the force wall, unable reach his comrade being disemboweled before him.
Pulling the focus of the other, the maul arced wide toward Guy as the shield slammed down toward Lamikel's spine.
Guy clenched as his back hit the wall, but the weapon slid off in a flash of oily green energy as Vaelyn's fingers contorted with a spell.

Yenna, leaping over the tangle of Strig and tiger bodies, swiped with an axe, but couldn't land the blow.
A third swipe and bite from Lamikel finally dropped the man, maul and shield falling to the floor.
Arc, recovered from his exertion, reached out a hand toward the greatsword below, gripping it mentally as its owner prepared to swing.
This managed to slow the next swing just enough to allow Yenna to bat it aside.
A second swing landed, slicing deep into Lamikel's exposed stomach.
Yenna brought down her own axe, ripping a large gash through the man's leather chest armor.

Vaelyn reached an arm toward her feline friend, weaving powerful healing energies into the motion.
Mirroring her movements from the floor above, Arc also concentrated on his friend.
Fighting against the Lady's curse, the tiger's wounds began to knit closed.
Feeling rejuvenated, Lamikel pivoted and repeated his feint and attack against the new opponent.
Sinking teeth into the man's abdomen, he felt something gush as the Strig went limp and fell to the floor.
Guy, not missing a beat, sank his glaive into the man's chest.

> Had to be sure.

The bloody form of Lamikel receded into Sorven, wounds shrinking but not looking any less serious.
Nodding and smiling at Guy, the old man fell to the ground, unconscious.

## On the Street

Fave and his Strig opponent circled each other, each unwilling to press the attack.
Seizing a momentary lapse of concentration, Fave swept out with a kick, knocking the man down.
His skull cracked against the cobblestones, immediately opening a bloody gash.
Fave dropped back into a defensive stance, but the larger man didn't stir.
A pair of heel stomps connected with the man's nose, crushing it and a cheekbone.

Edgar approached from behind them, picking up Fave's severed limb from the street.
Guards raced up at the same moment, yelling at the men:

> You two: down on the ground!
> Drop the arm!

Edgar and Fave hit the stones, the former pulling his medallion free and holding it aloft.
Seeing this, an approaching guard lowers his crossbow.

> You're with the Church?
> What's going on?

Edgar rattled off an explanation of the attack, including his theory that the party was hunting Guy.
Concerned for Fave's health, the guard calls for a cart.
Gingerly loading the young monk, the guards take off toward the Healing House, shouting after Edgar to meet them there. 
Edgar takes a moment to rally some more guards and send them to the Skeleton Key before sprinting down the street.

Five guards raced across the street, through the busted door hanging in jagged shards in its frame.
Seeing Yenna and Guy, they drew their crossbows and yelled:

> Strig!  On the ground, now!
> Dwarf, are you okay?

Yenna and Guy immediately complied, while Brorvec ran forward and waved the guards off.
It took several minutes, but everyone managed to convince the guards that the attack was over, and the remaining Strig were friends.

The house was thoroughly searched for stragglers, revealing a dead Larence, the stable hand, and his dog.
A thorough account was made, including a detailed description of the one Strig who managed to escape.
It takes several hours, but the guards eventually haul the bodies away, leaving the damage and gore for the others.

## Rest and Recovery

Edgar returns to the Skeleton Key, telling of his time at the Healing House with Fave.
Only a single healer of advanced skill had been available.
The odds were stacked against Fave, but through extensive prayer and attention, the severed arm is reattached, and both regain their full function.
Fave was kept overnight for observation, but the signs were good when Edgar left him.

Most of the 22nd-24th was spent dealing with the necromantic curse from the Lady.
Sorven, Vaelyn, and Del cycled between exhausting casts of powerful healing spells, with the former two teaching what they could to the latter.
More than two dozen spells were woven and cast, giving Del ample practice with healing magics.
Arc chipped in with his own healing efforts, though when the mages asked him to explain how it worked, he just shrugged.

In the downtime, Gavin laid out his plans for the expedition.
He has booked passage for the party on the _Albatross_, a merchant carrack, which will sail from the mouth of the Blackwater the evening of Bochdi, 29 Flocktime.
The _Albatross_ will transport the party to Vasiliki, along with its merchant cargo.
The voyage is expected to take between 4 and six days, depending on the winds and weather.

Once in Vasiliki, the party would need to explore the swampy hills south and west of the city to search for caves that might contain the wreck of the Cantwell.
He suspected that the wreck would be in a cave near the coast on the Point Ka'srang, the tip of the Vasiliki peninsula.
The coast was generally unapproachable from the sea, due to the frequent storms and shallow, coral laced water.
The party would likely need to hire a guide to lead them through the swamps and/or along the coast.

In addition to pre-paying your passage to Vasiliki, Gavin's investors provided a purse of:

- 5 Gold Royals ($ 700)
- 10 Silver Talents ($ 2,500)
- 5 Gold Teboks ($ 750)
- 10 Silver Crests ($ 300)

## Outcomes

* Everyone gets 2 XP.
* Edgar gets +1 XP for good scouting.
* Fave gets +1 XP for bloodlust RP.
