## Summary

We met up with **Gavin**, owner of _Skeleton Key Books and Maps_ (K4).
Gavin is a member of the city and is on the City Council.
He gave us 40 silver talents ($1000) to do a job for him: return the Tome of Asturias.
The book was written by a high priest of Helliconia and concerns the placement and impact of fey lines throughout the world (contains secret intersection of high power and high mana).
The book is very large and unwieldy — approximately torso-sized and covered in gold, platinum and jewels.

It was last seen in the possession of **Lady Dunwich**, who ruled the area between the Covari Mountains and the hills including Northunder and Everglen.
She was a known necromancer who was over 150 years old when she was murdered.
Before that, she built a large underground temple at the foot of the mountains.

Over time the entrance to Dunwich's temple was razed by the Church of the Seven to build their own temple, the Sept of the Maiden.
This temple was eventually sacked by orcs and was itself razed.

To get to the temple, Gavin told us to take the road to Northunder, then to find a local guide to take us west into the foothills.

Before we left, we bought supplies:

Item | # | $ ea | lbs ea | ∑ $ | ∑ lbs

Heavy Cloak | 4 | 50 | 5 | 200 | 20

Chalk | 4 | 1 | 0.25 | 4 | 1
Climbing Gear | 1 | 20 | 4 | 20 | 4
_Total_ | - | - | - |  808 | 126

The items were distributed out to the Strig (Yenna and Brorvec) to carry.
Edgar is the group's bank.

We spent the night in Blackwater, where Arc gambled away what money he had left.
In the morning we walked the road to Northunder, seeing a number of people coming south, including merchants, families, and even a prisoner.

We arrived in Northunder and found the Shivar Inn, owned and operated by Tara.
We ordered a variety of meals, including a goat stew and spiced water.
A number of other patrons were present, including:

* Will and Gus, local lumberjacks
* Al (halfling) and Mary

We talked to a number of people, seeking guides for the trip west.
Edgar used his status as a priest and managed to convince Will and Gus, for a $50 fee.
We were told the tale of a local criminal who had recently been caught — likely the one we'd passed on the road.
We were also clued into a local mystery: Farmer Taggert's cattle keep disappearing.
It might have something to do with the increased prevalence of orc raids, but it might be something more.

A domestic dispute broke out between two locals, Oduardo and Vera.
Tara managed to diffuse the tension, but Oduardo left in a huff.

We rented out the large nine-bed common room on the third floor and got some sleep, locking the door behind us.
Some time before sunrise, we were awoken with shouts of "fire!" from downstairs.
Del was the first to wake and found the stairs on fire.
He teleported down to the ground level, leaving the rest of the party to scale the side of the building.
The effort was mostly successful, with only minor injuries.

Del ran around to the back of the building, finding a well and someone trying to draw enough water to make a difference.
As we ended the session, Del was doing the math to figure out if his arcane skills would be up to the challenge of being a one-man fire team.

## Outcomes

* Everyone gained 1 XP
