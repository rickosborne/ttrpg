# Session 10: Secret Passages

## The Party

Everyone was present, with no substitutions!

## Summary

The party retraced their steps and headed along the northwest corridor.
It narrowed into a tunnel that wasn't much wider than Strig shoulders, ending in a concave room with a rounded wall.
Arc found a lever on the ground which caused the far wall to rise away, revealing the back side of a demonic statue.
The party stepped into the hall, realizing they were back just north of the central entrance chamber.

While the party debated how to proceed, Arc wandered off and made his way back eastward.
He returned a minute later reporting that he'd heard a sound at their previous intersection.
A thorough search of the area, and the two crypt rooms off that hall, found nothing suspicious.
The Strig began to get impatient, leading everyone back to the well chamber and the giant skull tablet.

Arc, with an effort of concentration, was able to maneuver the medallion into place in the eye of the skull.
Everyone was braced for something to happen, but the room was still.
Yen and Brorvec stepped up to the tablet and strained to turn it.
They heard a small click before the tablet locked into place and would not be moved further.

It's then, with her face close to the tablet, that Yen noticed the other eye socket in the skull also had the faint indentations of a Black Sun medallion.
Grumbling and groaning and out of options, the party resigned themselves to taking a swim in the water-filled pit they'd found in the southeast corner.

Arc, excited to get to see a new part of the sept, did his flying trick to scout the shaft.
He reported back that there was a passage that doubled back below their corridor, some five yards below them and at the water line.
He flew back down and continued to scout while everyone else talked through the logistics of getting that many people down a slimy, mold-covered stone wall.
Del had a crazy idea involving columns of water, but some quick arcane math showed he didn't have the reserves to move that much water for that long.

In the end it came down to Brorvec's strength — he was able to lower, one at a time, Guy, Edgar, Yen, and Sorven.
He made the offer to Del, who once again declined and concentrated to levitate himself down.
Brorvec then drove a piton into the seam between two stones and lowered himself to the water.

The water below was smelly and foul from untold years of being used as a bat latrine.
The first several yards of the corridor were under waist-deep water, before leading to a few stairs that brought everyone to dry stone.
The corridor seemed to be in line with the level above, turning from its southerly direction to the west before ending at a dark room.

Instruments of torture and death filled the space.
Human-sized cages, coffins with remains, and weapons of all shapes and sizes were strewn about, almost haphazardly.
Oddly, the party also found treasure, coin, magical scrolls, alchemical mixtures, books, and other items of value, disturbed but not taken.
Each adventurer made their way around to the things that looked the most interesting to them — Yen and Guy to weapons, Brorvec to coin, and so forth.
Arc, after a close call with some unnoticed caltrops spilled across the floor, took a moment to look around the room for potential light sources, eventually lighting a lantern and two candelabras.

Del, initially resistant to the temptation, eventually succumbed, opening his mage sight to look for magical items.
His eyes fell on some scrolls and some ointment, which he passed on to Yen to put in her backpack.
Sorven, noticing the ointment, took it aside to study.
He beckoned over Edgar and began applying the salve to his wounded arm.
Immediately, Edgar's limb was restored to its full function.
In his excitement, Edgar tried to do a back-flip off some stairs, only to fail and land poorly, hitting his face on a table.

The party eventually gathered back in the hallway, some two hours after lunch, and contemplated their next move.
