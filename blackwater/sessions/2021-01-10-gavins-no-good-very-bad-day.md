# Session 21: Gavin's No-Good Very Bad Day

Arc, returning almost six hours later, walked up to Guy with a cocked eyebrow and grin, dropping two grimy silver Talents into the Strig's large hands.
His return only made Yenna crankier, and she could be heard muttering about how stupid it was that casinos could run all day and night through Holidi, but she couldn't get a smith to fit her for armor.
"I have coin," she grumbled, "why can't I get anyone to take it?"
Arc opening his mouth as he passed, but closed it without saying anything upon seeing the large woman's glare.
Jangling a handful of copper Marks and Farthings, and looking like the cat who ate the canary, he strode off to his room to catch some rest.

Gavin led the party through the top floors of his building, which he referred to as [The Skeleton's Key](../reference/hq.md).
The party agreed that the accommodations were more than acceptable, and far better than they were likely to expect for any reasonable sum of money.
They were shown how the water pumps worked, and given freedom to redecorate as necessary.
While it would be a stretch to say that anyone showed excitement for the proposition, all agreed that it had more benefits than drawbacks.
Gavin pulled out a very brief and very standard annual leasing agreement, which everyone signed.

Several hours passed as people picked out rooms, gathered their equipment, and generally got comfortable.

### New Faces

Some time after lunch, Edgar returned with a new face he introduced as Fave.
A young man of maybe eighteen years and just over six feet, Fave was mute, though he and Edgar had some amount of sign language between the two of them that the latter was able to pass along at least the essence of what the younger was trying to get across.
Edgar explained that Fave was assigned to him as a bodyguard by the Church, after he'd left the Brotherhood of Balance and Harmony.
At this explanation, Fave twisted up his face in an expression of disdain toward the latter group clear to everyone in the room.

Later, Del showed up with a pair of guests: a young half-Elf woman, Vaelyn, and her daughter of maybe seven years, Rayna.
Vaelyn was skittish and soft-spoken, but explained that she and her daughter were fleeing pursuers and trying to arrange passage out of town and onto a new life.
She didn't feel she had much to offer for the party's help beyond her skills: a talent for the magics around history, tracking, and perception.

### Dinner Goes Cold

An offer for dinner arrived from Onella, the Skeleton Key's cook and housekeeper.
Seeing Guy's eyes go wide, she quickly explained that dinner was not to be expected, she wasn't paid enough to look after a building full of layabouts, but that Gavin had called for a feast tonight to celebrate the partnership.
No sooner had she explained this, then the man himself came through the door.

> I'm glad to see you all here, and I'm glad you've taken me up on my offer.
> I'm afraid to say I need your help already.
> Someone has stolen the strongbox from my office — the very one I would have paid you from!
> Worse, I think someone has kidnapped my daughter!
> Someone bumped into me on the street and shoved this note into my pocket.

Clutching at one leg and waving a piece of paper in the other hand, he was pale and seemed to be on the verge of collapse.
Rushing to his side, Sorven, Edgar, and Guy immediately began to assess his condition.
The source was easy to find: a puncture in one thigh, slowly leaking blood.
Laying him across a table and pulling down his tights, the wound was plain to see, and pulsing with black tendrils which lengthened slowly along his leg.

Sorven, turning to Yenna and flicking his eyes to her axes in the corner of the room, said coldly: "We need to remove his leg before the poison kills him."
Gavin, hearing this, gave a weak objection: "Wait, no, send Nick to the Order to fetch help".
Edgar also responded to Sorven's words, grabbing a dagger to slice away of Gavin's tights, which he then tied off high around the leg, trying to slow the spread of the poison.
Turning to Del, he asked: "Don't we have a scroll for this?"

Del, ashamed for having forgotten, rushed off to grab it.
Chanting and gesticulations already started before reentered the room, he worked his way through the Helic scroll, the ink erasing itself as he spoke.
With the final syllables of the incantation, he pressed his hand to the blackening flesh.
The discoloration in Gavin's leg faded, while at the same time Del slumped to the floor in his now-familiar sign of an exhausting effort, tossing a now-blank piece of aged parchment to the floor.

### Investigation

Edgar, now holding the paper he'd taken from Gavin, read aloud:

> Your atonement will be slow.
> Your daughter will be returned in small pieces.
> Regards from the Lady.

Del turned to Vaelyn and pointed at the note, asking "you said you had some skill with tracking — could you use that?"
She took several moments with the paper, muttering an incantation.
"I got a little, but could get more if we went to see where it happened."
Turning to Gavin, she asked if he was recovered enough to show her.

Daughter in tow, she and Gavin rushed out into the rain, followed by Sorven, Fave, and Edgar.
Pushing against the sheets of misting rain and wind, they made their way up Bridge Street until Gavin stopped them just outside the Blue Star Alchemy shop.
Edgar, doing his best to hide the new device within his hooded cloak, scanned the area with his spyglass.
He seemed frustrated by the results, eventually putting the item away, stepping into an alley, and vanishing.

Vaelyn, prompting Gavin to recreate the path he'd taken on his walk, looked around the area for puddles and standing water.
Asking the others to huddle around her and block passers-by from seeing what she was doing, she cast several more spells focused on the rainwater.
Once again, she seemed unhappy with the results she was getting.
Gavin, antsy about wasting time, pushed for everyone to return to the Skeleton Key.

Drying off and regrouped, Vaelyn relayed what she had learned.
The note had been written in a tavern, and then given to a young boy with red hair to give to Gavin.
The author of the note was a muscular man, though she wasn't able to get anything more specific about him.
Because the note was put into Gavin's pocket before he'd been stabbed, she wasn't able to tell if the same person had stabbed him, or someone else.
Edgar chimed in, saying he'd noticed a young boy watching the party as they investigated, though the boy had slipped away before he could be caught.

### Gerin

Coming up behind Gavin as the man was distracted, Del muttered a spell and touched him on his shoulder.
Grimacing but nodding, he seemed pleased with the result.
Without any attempt at tact, he asked: "How is your relationship with Gerin?  Do you have any reason to believe she might have taken the strongbox and fabricated a kidnapping as cover?"

Gavin replied without hesitation:

> Impossible.
> I've told Gerin for years that she is a bright young woman with far more talent than I, and she needs to go out into the world and seek her fortune.
> But she always refuses, saying she wants to stay here and take care of me.
> No, but I do think we need to notify the Order of her kidnapping as soon as possible, so they can begin a search.

Vaelyn stepped forward to Gavin: "I have magic which may be able to find your daughter, but it may take some effort."
With his nod of approval, Vaelyn began a long, elaborate ritual, in which she paced around in a circle, jabbed at the air, and yelled loud enough to cause Rayna to cover her ears.
The final screech was accompanied by a wavy illusion in the center of the room: Gerin, bound to an older tree, on a hill surrounded by some ruins.

Del, his eyes unfocused in that way the others had come to know as him watching and learning the flows of magic, winced.
He and Vaelyn stepped aside for a moment in a whispered huddle.
When they returned, the half-Elf shrugged to Gavin: "What we saw may not have been correct — these magics are difficult, and may be tampered with by outsiders."
Edgar, shrugging, said it was better than nothing, and he thought he recognized those hills as being just outside of town.

### The Strongbox

Sorven, noticing how run-down Edgar, Del, and Vaelyn were, pulled them into an adjoining room.
Without much fanfare, he put his fingers to the forehead of each and said a few words, jolts of revitalization flowing through them.
Del, ever observant to the old man's use of restorative magics, noticed that the two of them had done this enough times now that the effort didn't seem to cost the elder as much as it had in the past.

Stepping back into the main room, Vaelyn asked Gavin to show them to his office and the missing strongbox.
A concrete slab sealed into the wood flooring of the building, the clean and undamaged holes of the strongbox's legs were visible beneath the desk.
Gavin explained how the setup had been created, making it plain to everyone that the only way it could have been taken without damage was through magic.
Vaelyn, with Del attentive to her every gesture, swirled her hands over the area and spoke arcane words.
When she opened her eyes again she confirmed: "It was teleported from here magically, within the last few days."

Gavin explains that while the existence of the strongbox is not a secret, nor is it too widely known.
Maybe a dozen business associates in Blackwater have seen it, or are aware of it, on top of the laborers who put it in place.
