# Session 23: Slippery When Red

Walking two fingers across his palm, Fave tried to tell Yenna that Edgar had gone off on his own.
Yenna, frustrated that she couldn't get more information out of the monk, threw her hands in the air and told Sorven to deal with the teen.
Sorven, frowning with a cold gaze, replied with a simple "No" and turned away.
At an impasse, the trio ducked into Grey Alley to try to hide in the rain shadow of a building while they worked out a plan.
Out of sight of the few passers-by, Fave was able to communicate that Edgar was stealthily following some suspicious people a block to the west.

Farther down the street in that direction, Del hit his five-minute count, having seen no other activity from the White Mallard.
Paranoid about onlookers, he laid down on the wet street, melting the surrounding illusion to look like just another drunk passed out against a wall.
Unsteadily rising to his feet, he shuffled off back toward the Skeleton Key.

Approaching Gladstone Alley, Del caught sight of a large bald man in a butcher's apron with a cleaver and knife, scowling into the rain.
The man seemed to be focused on the air at the corner of a building, and while he appeared angered, he didn't seem hostile.
Del gave him a wide berth as he passed, asking if anything was wrong.
The man gave only a huffy dismissal.
Del kep walking, but in the exchange caught a flash of curly red hair from the shadows of the alley.

The old man approaching from the east had a familiar staff.
Del moved to approach him, but Sorven gave a quick shake of his head and kept walking past.
A beggar, huddled against the wall of Gladstone Alley, called to the two men.
While Sorven continued without a second glance, Del fished in the pockets of his cloak for loose change.
The man had no shoes and smelled awful, earning a trio of copper coins from Del.

Behind them, the butcher moved to press himself against the corner of the building, to keep an eye on Del.
Edgar, standing invisible in that exact spot, dodged quietly out of the way, getting behind the man.
This worked against him, however, as the man went to signal his companion in the alley.
His knife-hand bumped solidly into thin air, garnering a yelp and spinning jump in place.

## The Red Panics

Ed the Red, seeing this, bolted, scrabbling up the pile of carts and barrels to gain the roof of the building.
Edgar, eyes already on the boy, managed to catch him in a kneecap with a solid blow from one of his staves.
His momentum carried him through, though he fell to the roof tiles, grasping his leg and groaning.
Edgar, trying to follow, is unable to find the same purchase, slipping to the ground.
He tried again, with the same result, this time drawing the attention of the butcher.
The man called to his friend, still distracted by the invisible thing he knew was somewhere in the alley with him.

> You okay, Red?

Hearing the scuffle, Yenna and Fave leaped into action from their own alley.
Fave, assessing the situation, made to signal to Yenna that he was going to try to circle around the block to the north.
She missed it, however, as she was grabbing an abandoned broom leaning against a wall.
They both broke into runs, headed in opposite directions.

Sorven reached the butcher first, asking: "is everything okay?"
The butcher, suspicious, asked "who are you?"
Leaning on his staff in the rain, gave a curt "I'm a healer â€” I heard someone yell."

Pushing past the man into the alley, Sorven raised his staff toward the boy on the roof and yelled: "you, boy, watch out for that ledge!"
Any passing mage would have felt the fizzle of a failed spell, but the butcher seemed none the wiser.
He swung his cleaver through the empty air above Edgar's head.

Yenna, throwing a glance at Del as she ran past, caught up with Sorven.
Growling and brandishing her broom, she taunted the butcher: "What's going on here?"
The sight of a charging Strig was not lost on the man, who spat a curse at her:

> What do you want?
> Back off beast, or I'll be serving Strig stew next!

Edgar, using the distraction to his advantage, finally managed to make it up to the roof.
He caught sight of the limping boy, just sliding onto the second level, yards above him.

Below, Sorven and Yenna harried the butcher.
Sorven's attempts at knocking the man's feet out from under him went ignored, however, as he was distracted by the sight of the towering Strig woman snapping the thick broom handle in half, and twirling them with a flourish.
The butcher, looking intimidated for the first time, took a step back:

> Back off, or I'll call the Watch!

## Up and Down

Running past the beggar who was now distracted by the commotion, Del stepped up onto the flat of an abandoned cart and was suddenly atop the first roof, without crossing the distance between.
Again catching that flash of red hair, he took another step and was suddenly a half dozen yards away, cresting the peak of the second level.
Slick roof tiles beneath his feet, he slowed to an unsteady crab-walk, trying to catch sight of the boy.

The inky night, with no moon to speak of and only flickers of light from the torches below, was split by the sound of a cry and crash.
Spinning, Del caught a blur of motion as he saw the boy lose his footing and fall, head first, down the rain-slicked rooftop.

Flashing to too many times catching a falling Edgar in the sept, Del growled and reached out his staff.
The boy was still several yards away, but Del felt the spell land true.
Not an instant later and the boy was over the side, however, as the youth's instinct to flee batted away the grasp of unfamiliar magics.
A meaty thud signaled his return to the ground.

Del, appearing at the boy's side once again without crossing the distance, saw the injuries, but couldn't be sure whether he'd survive.
Mimicking the gestures he'd seen Sorven perform many times, he splayed his fingers across the bent neck and caved skull.
His first attempt failed spectacularly: he felt the spell take hold, but instead of the boy, it was the beggar at the end of the alley who let out a soft sigh.

In contrast, another meaty thud sounded between the two.
With a cry of pain, the crumpled form of Edgar appeared on the ground, holding a badly twisted knee.

Rolling his eyes, Del again focused on the boy, watching the life drain out of him.
Trying something less foreign, Del worked to weave his own vitality into his second attempt.
The magic took hold, pulling something in the lad's neck a little straighter, with an audible pop.
The arcane balance for the spell felt like a punch in the face, and Del immediately felt his own blood begin to flow from his nose down past his chin.

Seeing the futility of the situation, Del sank back against the wall, nearly exhausted from the effort.

## The Toll

> Look, I don't want any trouble, I don't know what's going on here.

The butcher backed away from Yenna, circled around her, and ignored the swipes from the staff of the old man behind him.
Sorven attempted another spell, but it again fizzled out as his swipe at the bald man's head went wide.
Yenna and the large man squared off for a moment until both heard the back-to-back thuds and yells.
All three turned and ran toward the sounds.

Seeing his friend in a heap on the ground, the butcher wailed: "oh, Red, what did you do?"
Del, looking up, called to him: "he's hurt, can you do anything?"
Crossing the distance to the corner of the building, the man found a large bell there and tolled it loudly, its tones crisp even against the drone of the rain.

Sorven strode up to Edgar, giving him what looked to be a callous kick to his injured leg.
Whispering a quiet spell, younger man felt his leg mend back to full function.
Standing, the two men walked back toward Del and the boy.
From the north end of the alley, Fave slid to a stop next to the group.

Yenna, catching up and pushing past them, dropped to her knees to assess the injuries.
Sorven, putting a hand on her shoulder, shook his head and said: "there's nothing you can do".
Hearing this, the butcher cried out again: "you killed him!"
Del standing up and walking toward the man, pointed at his own bloody face.

> You know this kid?
> Why did he tackle me?
> What's going on?
