# Session 14: Floors and Doors

## The Party

Everyone was present, with no substitutions!

## Summary

The morning arrived without event.
Arc took the last watch, using the brazier to heat up some jerky, hard cheese, and bread for the still-wounded group.
While they sat, Brorvec made an impassioned plea to Sorven to reconsider and heal the Strig.
Sorven looked disinterested and unmoved.
Though he did eventually heal them, it seemed almost on a whim.

Del explained to the group how he'd spent an hour inspecting whatever magics were layered on the Ravenwood book.
All he could tell for certain, without many more hours to study it, was that there were a number of enchantments which would be triggered by misuse of the book.
He admonished the party members to not mess with the book until he'd had more chance to study and possibly disarm it.
Brorvec offered to hold onto the book, and while Del eventually handed it over, his inner struggle was apparent.

Trying to clear his head, Del approached Yenna with an idea.
He suggested that she find something small and portable she could affix to her helmet — they could give her an upgraded version of the light spell in use by Brorvec and Arc.
She eventually settled on a tattered leather strap from the skeletal armor, which Del was able to infuse with enough arcane power to light up the entire chamber.
It made her difficult to look in the eye, but she would no longer have any visibility problems while they were underground.

Arc, at the same time, floated down the north corridor.
The roof was covered in tiles carved with the Black Sun insignia.
He returned several minutes later, telling of a split passage.
The western path was caved in and covered in rubble, similar to the western path from the central chamber.
To the east was a pair of doors, an inanimate skeleton, and some kind of sigil on the ground.

No one realized Edgar was missing until they heard the loud thump that echoed throughout the room, followed by his yell of pain.
Everyone ran toward the west hall, which was now alight with the orange glow of flickering flames.
They found Edgar, standing in a small chamber, surrounded by a cyclone of fire which was slowly descending from his shoulders.
He was alert, though he seemed unable to move out of the trap.
"Stay back," he yelled, "the floor is sticky!  It's magic!"

Arc was one of the first to approach, fingers at his temples and concentrating on something unseen.
The flames popped and snapped, but they seemed to part around Edgar, giving him some small breathing room.
The effort taxed him visibly as Yenna and Brorvec approached almost as a pair.
He offered up his shield and arm, which Yenna took as she leaned into the room, trying to hook Edgar with one of her axes.
She was able to get a grip on his collar, but lost it as he struggled to free himself.
Guy approached next, extending his glaive through the fire, concentrating to not gore his friend.
With a mighty heave by all, Edgar wrenched free of the enchanted floor and stumbled back through the doorway.

Arc found a wall to rest against, while Del proposed an idea: if a few people were willing, he could use the local prevalence of gate energies to probe the surrounding area for permanent portals.
It took four people and two attempts, but he was able to confidently state there were not any inter-dimensional rifts within the sept.

Edgar, meanwhile, found his own corner to kneel and pray to his patron.
It took some time, but when he rejoined the group he shared a vision he'd been given.
He told of a room full of torture devices and strange experiments on the dead and undead.
The vision also showed not one but two liches — the one they'd already met and Lady Dunwich herself.
He got a sense that the only way to get to them was through the well, which still required the second Black Sun medallion.

Arc beckoned Edgar to follow him down the northern hallway as the others looked on.
Not more than a few steps down the hall, Edgar tipped forward as the stone crumbled beneath his feet.
Del, already assuming the worst, was prepared with his staff extended.
Edgar shimmered in place for a brief moment, before disappearing and reappearing several steps back.
Everyone looked in the hole to see a large-toothed bear trap, armed and ready to take off a leg below the knee.

Sorven, also unsurprised, stepped forward to take Edgar's shoulder.
"Stand still," he said as Edgar moved to step back, "I have an idea."
Lightly carving a symbol into Edgar's forehead with his thumbnail, Sorven's eyes unfocused as he muttered a few words Edgar didn't understand.
"You have one minute free from worry about the traps," the old man squinted, "use it wisely."
He spun Edgar around, pushing him back into the hallway.
Del, at the same time, said an incantation that was familiar to the group, causing Edgar's eyes to glaze over in a glowing white.

Edgar stumbled, lurching left and right as the stone disintegrated beneath his steps.
Even as the floor gave way, the iron teeth beneath did not react to his presence.
Seeing this, Guy moved around the main room, collecting as many long bones as he could find.
Returning with his arms full of thigh- and shin-bones, he used them to trigger the traps.
Shattered bone splinters flew in every direction.

Edgar and Arc rounded the corner to the east.
Guy perked up at the sound of Edgar's gasp — this time not of pain but surprise.
Edgar peeked his head around the corner, eyes still glowing.
"There's a sigil on the ground over here, meant to serve as protection from demons.
And a door.  You should all see this."
One at a time, the group stepped gingerly, hugging the wall, to the end of the corridor.

Pointing at the door, Edgar started: "It's —"
"Enchanted," Del interrupted.  "Yeah, we can see that.  Hmm.
I think I have something that might help us here."

Del, again, called for willing participants to aid him in an arcane ritual.
The Strig again volunteered, along with Brorvec.
This ritual was short — just a few minutes later it was Del's eyes which went white.
"Damn," he was heard to mutter, "it's dark in there."
While still concentrating on his first spell, he tapped his staff to the ground and whispered the incantation for light they'd all heard many times now.

A gag caught in Del's throat.
Yenna started to move toward him, but he gripped her hand and told her to stay in place.

"That," he said with a hiss through clenched teeth, "is a very large demon.
We should maybe not go in —"
Another hiss of air through teeth.
"Damn.  Scratch that.  The second medallion is in there."
His eyes snapped back into focus as the irises seemed to fade back into view.
Asking Guy for some chalk from his bag, Del sketched out the room beyond on the stone floor.

The drawing showed a room maybe fifteen or twenty yards long, and a little wider than their current hallway.
In the center of the room Del drew a large circle, which he then filled in with a rudimentary skull before adding what might have been bat wings.
At the far end of the room he drew a rectangle with a big circle and a smaller next to it.
"Demon," he pointed to the large circle, "skull," to the medium circle, "medallion."

The party descended into a chaos of planning and hypotheticals.
They knew the door to be trapped somehow, but it would take time to peel back the magical obfuscation to gain details.
After a morning of trap after trap, they agreed as a team to take their time with this puzzle.
Del spent hours staring at the doors and the wall between them, tracing little arcane symbols in the air in front of him.
Now and then, Sorven would lean forward and tap Del on the shoulder, uttering some words and easing the strain on Del's face.

"Edgar," Del called, eyes still unfocused, "do you still have that big brass key you took from Yenna's bag?"
"Do not," he raised his voice as Edgar pulled out the key and moved toward the door, "do that just yet.
Something will happen, but I need more time to know what."

The admonition did not quell the impulses of the group.
If anything, knowing they had the key only heightened the desires to know what was on the other side of the door.
When Del shortly explained the gangrenous, rotting death which awaiting them if they guessed incorrectly, the fervor died down quite a bit.
Instead, the rest of the party entertained themselves with another bout of arm-wrestling.
While the Strig were originally assumed to be the clear winners, the matches were surprisingly even.
The Strig fought to find good positions, sprawled out across the narrow corridor on their stomachs, while the smaller humans had an easier time.

Some time later Del added the final bit of information he could find: a very large, very deadly fireball would consume everything in the corridor if anyone tampered with the wall or door.
Their options slowly dwindled to two: charge the door and hope for the best, or let Del try to teleport in and out.
Del again reiterated both the fiery and withering deaths, and was able to convince everyone to let him try.
Asking to borrow Yenna's daylight strap, he cinched it down and fitted it to his own head.
Leading them in a group ritual to reserve his strength, Del vanished with a small pop and a slight shift in the air.

Del appeared right where he expected, though he was turned around and disoriented for a moment.
The demon spoke as Del righted himself.

"Release me and I will protect you from the skull."

Del, seeing that the demon made no move to step out of the large pentagram and warding circle inscribed into the floor, snatched up the medallion before turning to talk.
"Why are you here?" he asked.

"Those you seek would use me to get into the book."
The words he spoke came out in Helic, but seemed to also have echoed whispers in other languages at the same time, as if the demon was speaking all languages at once.

"Where is the book?  Is it near?"

The demon's leathery wings twitched, but Del couldn't tell if it was in impatience or something altogether alien.
"Not far.  They have it with them in their chambers."

It was then that Del noticed the skull within reach had started glow the sickly purple of a fading bruise.
Not wanting to see what the skull would do, he tapped his staff to the ground and repeated the words which would take him back to where he'd started.
Del caught the Demon's parting words from both places at once: "I warned you."
The dissonance of it threw him off guard, giving him a vertigo that sent him into the wall.

As he was recovering, the enchanted doors flew open.
The skull spirit could be seen flying across the room toward the party.

## Outcomes

3 points for everyone, but 4 for Brorvec (for jokes), Guy (for jokes), Sorven (for _Steelwraith_), and Del (for _Glass Wall_).
