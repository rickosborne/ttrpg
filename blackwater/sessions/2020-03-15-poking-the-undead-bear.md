# Session 6: Poking the Undead Bear

## The Party

We were joined by Jessica, Daniel's wife.
She opted to lurk instead of taking over a character.

## Summary

Everyone had a moment of paranoia about their bags and loot pile, so Del took a minute to set up an alarm spell beneath the entrance in the central chamber.
The party was also split about the meaning of the engraving they found, but they felt it was reasonable to explore the room before doubling back to the statue.

Moving into the next room, the party found several branches in the path.
The north and south routes each led to narrow hallways, while the east path led to another room.
In the space before the eastern room, the party came across a basin of stagnant water.
The basin was the size of a large bird bath, made of some obsidian-like stone.
It didn't have any carvings or engravings, but fit the demonic theme of the statues.
The dank water and dark stone made it too hard to see how deep the water went.

Just past the basin into the next eastward room, Arc and Edgar came across a large capstone-like fixture.
It looked like it would probably fit on top of the basin, and was carved with a large skull.
The eyes of the skull were removed, though it seemed obvious to Arc and Edgar that at least one of the sockets was intended to contain a gem or similar fixture.
The back of the socket was carved with the same Black Sun insignia as the undead armor.
It also looked like at least parts of the skull or capstone could be moved or rotated.

The party followed the southern hallway to find a pair of rooms with more stone coffins.
Yen and Brorvec came up with a plan to open the coffins one at a time, taking out the undead in a more orderly fashion.
The first one went down fast due to some icy overkill from Del.
But it was enough to wake up the rest of the undead, which began to approach from all sides.

The second undead, carrying an axe and shield, didn't go down as quickly.
Yen took a swipe to the gut, inflicting significant damage.
Archers approached from the side, catching Sorven in the neck.

Edgar and Prur called upon their deities, keeping the undead at bay with the power of their faith.
But it was clearly a stopgap measure.
Prur was able to stun two of them for several seconds.

The battle did not go well.
Both mages cast enough spells to wear themselves down to the point of exhaustion.
Everyone was able to retreat into the western room, where two of the three undead had been defeated, while the third continued to try to push away Arc from sitting on the coffin lid.

## Outcomes

Since we stopped mid-battle, we'll do XP next week.
