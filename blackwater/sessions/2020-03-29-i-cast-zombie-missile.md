# Session 8: I Cast Zombie Missile

## The Party

Gus was unable to join us, so Jessica ran Prur.
Towards the end of the session she was able to introduce her character: Guy, the Strig mercenary ranger.

## Summary

The fight continued against the two undead knights and at least one more unseen archer.
Yen continued kneeling and trying to make herself less of a target behind Brorvec.
Edgar, attempting to assert his faith against the knight, got too close.
The knight swung out for him.
Arc tried to interpose, but Edgar was able to step back and dodge the swing.
But this left Arc open, allowing a knight to get in a major wound.
Arc stayed conscious, but reeled from the hit.

Yen also took a sword to the chest, causing her to go back into a berserking rage.
Brorvec and Prur were able to position themselves to hold the focus of the knights, with Prur asserting his faith to push them back toward the edge of the stairs.
While trying to fight around Arc, who had stepped in front of her when he saw how badly wounded she was, Yen missed the knight and accidentally clubbed Arc, knocking him out.
Del, also alarmed at the amount of blood coming out of Yen, was able to magically redirect an incoming arrow back to its source.
Yen's next swing was able to take out one of the knights, giving her a moment to breathe and get herself back under control.

At the same time, Sorven the Old stepped past the piles of corpses to join the front lines.
He fought with a fury, raining an onslaught of staff blows down on one of the knights.
He got in several solid hits, pulling the focus of the knight away to provide opportunities for the rest of the party.
Brorvec was able to finish off the other knight and made his way down and across to the other set of stairs.
Del was able to bring up an exceptionally bright light, illuminating the two skeleton archers sniping at them.

The second archer had finished repairing its bow, and now both were readying to fire.
Seeing this, Yen dropped her axe and threw a chakram at one, letting out a resounding ululation.
The chakram landed squarely in the archer's chest, followed soon after by a second right next to it.
Yen, frustrated at running out of weapons to throw, reached down and picked up one of the undead corpses.
She chucked it at the archers but wasn't able to connect, the corpse falling to a heap against the far wall.
Edgar, thinking quickly, went invisible and jumped down to the ground level.
He ran over to the archer Yen had targeted and was able to take it out with a swipe at its legs.

It took several more seconds, but Brorvec was able to bring down the second archer, finally clearing the room of all enemies.
Del slumped against a wall, fatigued and failing to control his shaking hands.
He must have passed out, as the light illuminating the space winked out while Sorven was attending to Arc.

The party took a little more than a half hour in the stairwell to get Arc stable and let everyone rest.
Thankfully, no additional enemies showed up.

The party made their way back to the central room where it was agreed that Edgar would go up and check to see if the orcs had returned.
His hands, sweaty from the climb, lost their grip on the rope just as he was almost at the top.
He grabbed for the rope, but his injured arm couldn't take the strain and he continued to fall.
Del, remembering the trouble the party had on the way in, had prepared for this and was ready with a spell to catch Edgar before he hit the ground.
The spell took a lot out of him though, and he again dropped to the ground, fatigued.

Sorven, Brorvec, and Yen decided to try a different approach.
Sorven infused Brorvec with additional strength, allowing him to make it to the top without undue effort.
On the ground, Yen made rope harnesses for each of the party members in turn.
Arc was able to do his flying trick to aid their ascents.

Del, grumbling under his breath about reckless meatheads, refused to use the rope.
Instead, he took his time to recover his strength before standing and turning to the waiting Arc.
Thinking he had more trust in his own magic than the arm strength of others, he took a moment to improvise a spell to allow him to float to the surface.
The spell again took quite a bit out of him, and it was very rough around the edges, but it worked.
Feet landing on the stone and grass of the temple, he turned and went to the tents and collapsed without another word.

Sorven and Prur worked their way through the party, getting everyone healed back up over the next several hours.
Edgar tried to help, but was not able to contribute much with his rope-burned hands.

Sometime mid-afternoon, raucous shouts could be heard from multiple Strig throats.
Approaching the ruins, with joyful recognition from Yen, came a large Strig ranger.
Guy, as the party eventually learned was his name, and Yen had known each other for some time.
He'd heard that the party was making a path in this direction, and had made the trek alone to catch up.
Guy was a visually striking figure, with his too-pale skin and hip-length red hair.

## Outcomes

The party got 7 points for the session, bringing most people up to 184.
Rick got 1 extra point for Delwyn for his particularly egregious puns â€” specifically for asking if we were really going with the "let the bodies hit the Bror" strategy.
Finally enjoying a long rest, most of the players spent a good chunk of time applying experience points to their characters.
