# Session 11: Guy Gets Boned and Edgar Gets Stoned

## The Party

Everyone was present, with no substitutions!

## Summary

Piling up their loot, the party faced the logistical challenge of how to get it all back upstairs.
They considered several options, including having Sorven shape the stone walls of the well and having Del teleport himself with whatever he could carry.
Yen, getting frustrated at all the talking, grabbed the rope already hanging from the floor above, and made her way up.
Edgar followed, not waiting for anyone to tie him off, and then wandered off back up the corridor on his own.

Yen aided Brorvec in his ascent, who in turn lifted the bag full of loot.
As he did so, the halberd that had been looped into the side of the bag caught on the wall, twisting around and falling free.
Guy noticed it too late and couldn't get out of the way in time.
The spike of the halberd drove itself into his chest, sinking deep past his armor.
Guy yanked the halberd free, throwing it across the hall.

Sorven was at Guy's side within seconds, applying his healing ministrations.
He took the time to make sure Guy was stable before getting looped into the rope and pulled up by Brorvec.

Guy's first attempt at an ascent went just as poorly, losing his grip and tearing free of his knotted harness just below the edge of the floor.
He fell to the water, twisting and landing in an awkward flop.
Hearing Brorvec laughing at him, Guy grabbed a loose bone from beneath the water and pelted Brorvec in the chest with it.
After he caught his breath, Guy told Del of a passage he noticed while he was under the water.
The commotion attracted Arc's attention, who immediately made to swim into the passage.
Guy followed him after a few moments, asking Del for a light to follow him.

Arc resurfaced a few moments later, asking Del for something brighter.
Del explained that he could make a more lasting solution, but he'd need something small as a focus.
Arc provided his lucky deck of cards, which Del was able to make glow with the light of a torch.
Arc again dove under the water, followed by Guy, both disappearing from Del's sight.

Arc and Guy passed through an underwater hallway and noticed it had a gentle current from west to east.
The chamber beyond was also half full of water, but this time had some interesting features on the ceiling.
Arc floated out of the water and up along the wall to get a better look.
He found a chain attached to the ceiling and wall and yelled out descriptions of what he was seeing.

Del relayed those descriptions, which intrigued the returning Edgar enough to climb back down the rope and go swimming after Arc.
Edgar immediately figured out where they were: beneath the trap see-saw floor he'd almost fallen into.
Edgar then explored a bit and found a matching stone grate that seemed to be the source intake for the water.
Arc and Guy followed, and the three eventually made their way back to Del.

Edgar made to ascend the rope but didn't account for wet hands and soaking armor, slipping and falling back into the water.
Guy made himself a rope harness and was pulled up by Brorvec, who took the opportunity to dunk Guy a few times at the start.
Del, getting the hang of levitation, grabbed the forgotten torch and lantern and floated up to meet the party.
Along the way he noticed another ledge above them, again doubling back along a parallel hallway.

Arc, ever the scout, floated up with his card deck light to look around.
Floating back down, he told everyone that he'd found two wooden doors and a room beyond which looked like it was full of torture instruments and coffins.
He then took one end of Brorvec's rope and floated back up to fasten it to the large handles on the doors.

Edgar again attempted to climb the rope and again fell as he neared the top, falling all the way to the water below.
Arc unfastened the rope and lowered it to Edgar where he was again able to rejoin the group, and then refastened it to the doors.
Sorven was able to heal what felt like several cracked ribs before Edgar again made the climb to the upper level.
Edgar stayed visible, instead relying on stealth and sure footing to avoid traps.
As he began to search the room Yen was able to make the climb and join Arc in the hallway.

Brorvec made the climb next, but quickly found that his glowing helm disturbed the bats roosting above.
They attacked as he gained his feet, swarming the hallway and beginning to flow down the shaft.
Their claws and teeth weren't supernatural, but there were enough of them in an excited state to inflict significant damage on the trio.
Yen, empathetic to creatures just frightened and defending their home, managed to control her rage until one group of bats got in a particularly nasty gouge across her acid-weakened chest.
Cleaving her axes through the cloud of chiroptera, she gored and frightened enough bats to scare off the colony.
Immediately feeling guilty, she ran over to Arc, who had taken enough of a beating to knock him out, and began applying first aid.
In her excitement, however, she didn't manage to do much more than stabilize him, calling down for Sorven to come help.

Sorven, not wanting to count on ropes and harnesses, asked Del for a trade: Sorven would supply the energy if Del could help him float.
Del was already running on empty from improvising so many spells, but agreed.
The two of them waited for Guy to climb up, then floated up to join the group.
Sorven was able to get Arc healed up and back on his feet, while Del assumed what was becoming a familiar stance: sitting against a wall attempting to rest while the group figured out what to do next.

Brorvec, trying to keep the group entertained while they waited on Del and Edgar, challenged Yen to arm wrestling.
She feigned disinterest before launching herself at him, pushing him back several feet into a wall.
This opened up the doorway for Sorven to see what lay beyond, piquing his interest.
He, Brorvec, and Arc decided they didn't want to wait to see if the room had traps and stepped inside.

Edgar reported back to the hallway with a few absconded items he thought might be of interest to the magic users.
Del, tired of the anti-magic side-eye from Edgar, told him the only way he'd help is if Edgar agreed to have his third eye opened to magic.
Asking Yen, Arc, Guy, and Brorvec to lend their energy to the effort, Del chanted and had the group draw arcane sigils in the air with their fingers.
A few minutes later Edgar gasped and went slack-jawed, racing into the other room.
He jibbered mostly incoherent nonsense about colors and bubbles for a minute before returning with a few more items.

Brorvec decided he wanted to try, so Del repeated the ritual.
He, too, was overcome by the added sense and began wandering about the room.
Not minding his footing, he felt the floor shift before hearing the familiar sound of stone grating against stone.
Not but a few yards away he saw the familiar site of armor-clad skeletons rising and focusing on him.
