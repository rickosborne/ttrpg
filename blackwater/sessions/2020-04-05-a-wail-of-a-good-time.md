# Session 9: A Wail of a Good Time

## The Party

Gus was finding the schedule hard to keep and has bowed out.

## Summary

The party spent the rest of the evening resting and recovering from their wounds.
Prur, shaken by his experiences, could be found praying until well past dark.
The party awoke on the morning of the 10th of Flocktime, 852, to find it misty and dark, but also to find Prur gone, along with all his gear.
Everyone was sad to see such a jovial individual cowed, but no one could fault him for his choice.

The party prepared to go back down into the sept, Yen making rope harnesses and Brorvec bracing to lower each in turn.
Del, remembering the last two traversals, concentrated for a moment and for a second time managed to emulate Arc's levitation trick.
He floated through the hole to the floor of the sept, positioning himself to keep an eye on the entirety of the rope.
The others gently mocked his paranoia, but as Edgar lost his grip and failed to recover, Del was able to halt his fall just before the ground.
Exhausted by the effort, Del slumped to the ground and warned the rest that he didn't have the capacity to catch a second.

The others, somewhat more somber, made their way down into the sept without further drama.
Del needed some time to recover, so Arc and Edgar scouted the immediate area to ensure all was as they'd left it.
Guy, bored and itching to get moving, challenged Brorvec to an arm wrestling match.
They struggled for some time, but Brorvec's advanced experience won the day.

Del, frustrated at constantly having to manage his floating light, beckoned Brorvec to him.
Del concentrated for a moment before giving Brorvec a sharp rap along the seam of his helm with his staff.
The front of the helm flashed before settling into a cool glow, illuminating several yards in front of them.
This came in handy as the party moved back along the east corridor to the well, stepping carefully to each side of the trick floor.

Again inspired and curious, Del stepped forward and touched his staff to the surface of the pool.
But this time his clever ideas were for naught — the water cleared a little, but otherwise was inert.
Edgar was able to bring a light closer and pick out the bottom of the pool, some two to four yards below.
They had the thought of putting the giant skull capstone on the well, but it turned out the capstone was affixed to the floor.
Instead, the group decided to retrace their steps down the southern corridor.

The corridor curved around to the east before ending in a wooden door.
To a person, each prepared for Brorvec to open the door: Del with ice at the end of his staff, Guy with arrow nocked, Arc with stones aloft, and the rest with their means.

The door opened to a small room matching the ones seen previously: three stone coffins, side by side.
But instead of undead fighters, this room contained two statutes that began to move, their stone flesh melting away to stubbly, dark canine hide.
"Hellhounds!" yelled Edgar as everyone charged in.
One of the hounds took several shots before they were completely roused, though the blows did not have much effect.

The hellhounds moved with preternatural agility and intelligence, dodging blows and keeping their assailants at length.
As one, they moved next to each other and let loose jets of flame into the corridor.
Brorvec was able to take one jet on his shield, feeling its heat flow over and past him.
The other jet required more drastic measures: Yen jumped for cover, finding herself in one of the empty coffins, while Guy was able to throw himself to the other side of the hall, the jet singing the red hairs on his arms.

After the heat dissipated, Arc and Del stepped forward, each hoping the hellfire would take some time to regenerate.
Arc was able to send several stones into the beasts, finding his earlier efforts had improved his control.
Del's efforts were not so effective — his small ice projectile doing no more than a gnat's bite before melting against the shimmering heat coming off the hide.

The second gouts of hellfire came faster than anyone expected.
Again, Brorvec was able to deflect one blast with his shield, and again Guy was able to dodge out of the way.
Del disappeared without moving, leaving an unfortunate Arc to take the full force of the blast.
The pain of the burn drove Arc to his knees, but he was able to stay upright in front of the reappearing Del.
Sorven reached out and relieved him of much of the pain, though Arc was moving slowly from the shock.
Brorvec's mace took down the first hound, causing the third occupant of the room revealed itself.

A spectral visage floated through the unmoved stone lid of the middle casket.
Again, Edgar was quick to shout: "Banshee!"
Almost immediately the spirit let out a keening wail that reflected around the stone walls.
Yen and Edgar dropped to their knees, hands to their ears and faces creased with shock and pain.
A third jet of flame was again blocked by Brorvec before Guy was able to skewer the beast on his glaive.

The party moved to focus on the spectre, but mortal weapons had no effect.
Del's eyes clouded over before Arc could hear him mutter, "she was an elf, a tortured soul".
He then made a complex series of warding gestures, but found his arcane tools had no effect on the necromantic entity.

Edgar, after taking a few seconds to recover, moved to strike at the spirit with his blessed, silver-edged weapons.
It seemed surprised by the impact, again loosing a ear-piercing wail.
This time Guy and Arc took the brunt of the psychic attack, Arc again dropping to his knees from the effort to stay conscious.
Seeing her new friend go down, Yen let out a furious roar to match the Banshee, grabbed Edgar's blessed staff, and bludgeoned the ghost until she dissipated into a mist.
Rushing to Arc's side, Yen was able to apply her limited medical skills to get him stable until Sorven could get him back on his feet.

Del did not recover from the psychic trauma of the fight as quickly.
Slumped against the stone wall of the corridor, he could be heard muttering to himself about elves and demons.
Again, everyone took time to rest and recover.

The party made their way back to the well, where Arc's curiosity got the best of him.
Stripping out of his armor, Arc tied one end of a rope around his waist before giving the other end to Brorvec.
He dove in without much ceremony, gasping against the ice-cold water.
He disappeared beneath the surface for several seconds before reappearing and hauling himself out and shivering.
The well did indeed go down several yards, where it ended in a square-bottomed shaft, otherwise unremarkable.

The northern corridor from the room was the last unexplored option.
Del groused about the inevitability of a symmetric layout with more hellhounds and banshees.
This seemed initially confirmed with the matching pair of three-coffined rooms along the hall.
But instead of a bend, this corridor ended in a tee.
An open room could be seen to the east, so everyone headed that direction.

They found a small, single-coffin elliptical room, overlooked by another stone statue.
Del remarked that this statue seemed oddly different than the others, vaguely elf-like, but also something else.
But it was Arc who was willing to venture close enough to the casket to read the ancient Calach inscription on its lid:

    Theonopholis, Master Architect  
    Alchemist, Teacher, and advisor

The inscription was scratched out with the word TRAITOR in an angry scrawl.

Edgar voiced that they should remove the lid to the coffin and dispatch whatever might lay within.
Guy and Del dissented, staying back in the hall, but did not move to block the effort.
Yen, Edgar, and Arc readied themselves around the lid as Brorvec shoved it aside.
A clicking sound was heard before the room was crossed with jets of acid, striking all four of them.

The smell of acid eating through leather and steel armor permeated the area.
Each of the four targets looked down to find their armor permanently marred and corroded.

Edgar, quickest to recover, reached for the ancient book visible at the foot of the coffin.
It disintegrated between his fingers, though he was able to salvage a half dozen scraps for later investigation.
Brorvec was second to react, reaching out to grab a black medallion in the familiar Black Sun shape.

## Outcome

Most of the party was awarded 2 XP, but Corri was awarded 3 XP for Yen's well-played empathetic battle rage, recovery, and first aid for Arc.
