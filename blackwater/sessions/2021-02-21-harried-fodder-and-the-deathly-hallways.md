# Session 26: Harried Fodder and the Deathly Hallways

Standing around the uncapped well in the basement, the party debated their options.
They could have tried to get some sleep, but then that might have caused Gavin to panic.
They could have scouted the final red dot, either via the streets or via the sewers.
Some argued that the path through the sewers was unknown, with hidden dangers.
Others argued that the street-level path meant they could not wear armor or have visible weapons, and the mages would have trouble operating out in the open.
In the end, everyone agreed the route through the sewers was the better path.

Yenna, leather map in one hand, sewer map in the other, found her agitation growing.

> I have a bad feeling about this place.
> We need to go.
> All of us.

She headed upstairs to go wake the sleeping mages, even though it was just past midnight.
Del resisted, saying the others should scout ahead, but one raised eyebrow from Yenna was enough to get him moving.
As the party geared up, he grabbed two lengths of leather strapping, intoned a pair of incantations, and caused them each to give off the light of a torch.
The effort cost him, erasing the gains from the last several hours of sleep.

Yenna lowered herself down, and pulls tight the bucket rope.
Del and Sorven looked dubious about being tied in and lowered into the sewer.
Without a fuss, Del tapped the older man on the shoulder, causing him to float a few inches above the ground.
In a slow, graceful swim through the air, the mage lowered through the well and touched down gently on the stones of the sewer below.
Del followed a moment later, and the two sat back against the wall to wait for the others and regain their strength.

One by one, Guy lowered Rayna, Vaelyn, and Fave into the sewer.
The rope slipped a bit during Rayna's descent, though the child thought it was a game, and yelled a gleeful hoot as she dropped.
Guy was able to catch her, losing a bit of skin on his palms.
Vaelyn, noticing, held a finger to her lips before tapping Guy on the shoulder and healing the rope burn.

The party lined up and walked in a pair of queues along the side walls of the tunnel.
Edgar counted off the turns and splits, keeping everyone moving in a generally southeasterly direction.
Getting close to the destination, the party arrived at a gate blocking their path.
Investigating, Edgar found a locking mechanism that was old and rusted through.
He began to pick it, but it was slow going.

Del, taking advantage of the break, commented on a stone set into the flow of the water.

> That's odd, right?
> That's the first time we've seen a raised stone like that.

It didn't look any newer than the rest of the system, but it was odd.
Above the stone, as Guy and Yenna moved closer and brought it into the light, some kind of round hatch was set into the ceiling.
Fave took a moment to investigate the stone, but it appeared completely normal.
It held his weight when he stepped onto it, putting him in reach of the hatch.

## Bad Acid Trip

Fave lifted the grating and pushed it aside.
As he pulled himself up through the hole, he saw the glint of a piece of wire slipping free from where it had been wedged.
He had time to make a signal of some kind to Del, who sighed and took a step back.
A crash of breaking glass was followed by the slow ooze of something wet down Fave's chest, back, and neck.
Moving quickly, he pulled himself the rest of the way up and rolled out of the splash zone.

Exposed skin already on fire, his jacket began to smoke where the acid touched it.
He stripped out of the leather before tossing it back through the hole as a warning.
The acid continued to pour as he looked up in the dim light to investigate the mechanism.
The other end of the now-loose wire wrapped around the haft of a large hammer on a pivot.
When the tension was released, it had smashed into a large glass jar, releasing the unguent, which poured out across a perforated copper cone, spreading it across an area more than a yard wide.

In the sewer below, Edgar watched as the acid dripped onto the stone platform, raising wisps of smoke where it landed.
Dipping his canteen into the river water, he tossed it up to Fave.
The pair went through several iterations, giving Fave enough water to wash the caustic substance away from the edges of the hole.
When Fave signalled he's had enough, Edgar walked over to Yenna and pointed at her glowing headband.
She grumbled, but untied it and handed it over so Edgar could toss it up to his ward.

The young man gave two whistles, which Edgar translated to mean: "have Yenna come up and help lift people through".
Yenna was happy to do so, if only to get back to her light source.
Fave, moving slowly ahead, rounded a corner before quickly moving back and gesturing to Edgar.
He pointed to the headband, flashed three and six fingers, and jammed the light source into his pocket.
One by one, Edgar, Vaelyn, Rayna, and Sorven disappeared through the hole.
Losing the light, Yenna shot Fave a look, causing him to toss the headband to her feet.

As Del was getting into place, the bright, flickering light of a blaze shone through the hole, accompanied by a recognizable yelp from Edgar.
He'd triggered a trap familiar to those who'd been in the sept: a magical glue fixed the feet to the floor, while a burst of human-height fire sprang into place around him.
Yenna, already working to grab Del, nearly flung him up to their level as she turned and rushed to the edge of the blaze.

## He's On Fire.  Again.

Edgar was nowhere to be seen, though a vague human-shaped hole seemed to struggle in the middle of the flames.
Vaelyn stabbed with her ancient-looking staff, loosing a spell that wrapped Edgar in what looked like translucent chitinous plates, before fading into invisibility.
He managed to break free of the magical glue, getting enough momentum to move beyond the flames, his smoldering cloak and armor giving off wisps of smoke from invisible shoulders.
Yenna, too close to the fire to see what was happening on the other side of it, waved her arm through the fire, trying to get a hold of the man she assumed was still inside it.

Through the wall of heat, Sorven's staff prodded Edgar in the back, setting off a spell with the octarine glow of healing magic.
All three mages made confused noises as they saw the same thing: the spell almost took hold, then fizzled as it should have woven into his being.
Something on Edgar's person blocked had the spell.
Guy, just getting to his feet after pulling himself through the hole, saw three confused mages and a wide-eyed kid, a wall of flame, and a frantic Yenna with her arm flailing around in the magical inferno.

Edgar called out that he was okay, but it was cut off by another yelp from the darkness on the other side of the rounded corner.
This time it was Fave, whose cry was accompanied immediately by the sounds of struggle and heavy thuds.
Locking eyes, the Strig had the same idea at the same time.
Each backed up, pushing the mages into the corner, before taking running jumps through the fire.

Guy landed first, right on top of Edgar, pushing him back several steps.
Yenna stumbled in the shifting light, landing short.
Vaelyn was the fastest to react, once again jabbing her staff into the flames, trying to wrap the Strig in the same chitinous plates.
Seeing her new friend on fire was too distracting, however, and the spell dispersed before it could take hold.
Guy reacted quickly, reaching back and pulling Yenna out from the flames.

The two pairs of head-lights illuminated the far end of the next hallway, where the young monk could be seen impaled on a quartet of large spears.
Both called "he's hurt" at the same time.
Del turned to Sorven, muttering an incantation.

> Sounds like you're going to be needed over there.

With a tap of Del's staff, the older man found himself once again floating free of the ground.
The younger man made skittering motions with his hands, causing the other to rise up and float to the wall beside the fire.
Sorven continued the motion, pulling himself along the stones and clearing the flames.
Yenna, breaking into a run, grabbed the floating mage and pulled him along the hallway.

Despite the pain, Fave managed to center himself and began to make heavy, chopping strikes against the thick hafts of the spears.
Each blow splintered the wood, but also tore at his flesh, causing more and more blood to stream to the floor.
He panted from the effort and pain, managing to break off two of the four spears before finally blacking out.

Vaelyn, eyes wide and flicking back and forth between the gasps and yelps of the young monk and the wall of fire between them, reached down to take her daughter's hand.
The pair ran into the flame, slowing to a stop almost immediately, feet adhering magically to the floor.
Their cloaks held back the heat, and Vaelyn was able to put her own body between most of it and her child, but the protection wouldn't last long.

Del, with a hiss, shook his hands and released the magics he'd been weaving to keep Sorven aloft and mobile.
With large, sweeping arcs of his staff and arms, and a yell that bounced along the stone walls, he jabbed the butt of his staff into the core of the fire.
A pulse of nothingness radiated outward, having no other visible effect, as the flames continued to burn.
The Elves, however, found they were once again able to lift their feet, and quickly moved out of the trap.

Sorven didn't miss a step as he was dropped to the floor.
Yards away from the young man, he pointed his staff and loosed the magics for one of his largest heals.
The unconscious young man sighed as the blood pouring from him slowed to a trickle. 

## Outcome

* No points until at least the next session.
