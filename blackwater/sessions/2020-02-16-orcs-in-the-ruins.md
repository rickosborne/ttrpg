_Session 2_

# The Party

Brorvec stayed behind in Northunder to wait for our incoming Dwarven companion.

# Summary

The Shivar Inn was a complete loss.
The general consensus was that it was obviously Oduardo who committed the arson, as he disappeared downriver in his boat.
The town sent a rider to Blackwater to attempt to head him off.
There was consideration of tracking down Vera at Jed's house, but it ultimately seemed like a thin lead.
Tara seemed resigned to the idea that there was likely no justice to be gained, so the party continued on their way.

The journey along the road was warm and sunny, along well-maintained bridges fields just beginning to be tended by halfling farmers.
Along the way, Del noticed a Roc in the distance, carrying cattle in each claw.
None of the party had ever seen a Roc before, but most had heard of them.
It was headed in the same westerly direction, though at a much faster rate.

The party traveled most of the day, getting into the lightly wooded foothills just as the sun was setting.
Yen was the first to notice the smell of smoke, followed by Del picking out the sound of Gerrig voices.
In the ruins at the top of the hill, the very ruins the party sought out, was a group of carousing orcs.
Edgar reconnoitered the area, counting at least eight — six around the fire and two obvious guards.

The party considered whether to sneak away without confrontation, but ultimately most members were swayed by their impulsive and overconfident natures.

Edgar opened the fight with an attempted assassination of one of the orcs, which unfortunately didn't manage to make it through the orc's pot helm.
Edgar kept at it, though, eventually dropping the orc.
Yen charged in with an echoing ululation and the zing of her chakram, embedding it into the back of one of the orcs.
Del got the first confirmed kill, sending an ice sphere into one orc with enough force to knock him back a number of yards.

Yen was the clear star of the fight, drawing fire from pretty much every orc in visual range.
She dual-axe sliced her way through a half-dozen enemies, downing at least three of them herself.
Unfortunately, Yen's berserker rage got the better of her.
As the remaining orcs fled, she turned to rush Del, striking him down with a major blow before passing out herself.

The session closed with the remaining conscious party members struggling to apply enough first aid and healing to get everyone stable.
