# Session 7: Slow and Unsteady

## Summary

The battle was not going well for our party.
Yen took a series of hits as the undead began to overwhelm Edgar's faith.
Mace, axe, and arrow tore away at Yen, bit by bit.

Brorvec, yelling "Get back!" was able to pull Yen back into the doorway, taking her place on the front line. 
That gave everyone enough time to regroup and ready themselves for the next wave of attacks.
It took him several seconds, but he was able to briefly convince Yen to stay behind him and attack over his head.
The plan worked, but only until Yen ran out of things within reach, whereupon she stepped back out into the hallway.

Arc signalled Sorven to come sit on the coffin lid to keep the third undead in the room from escaping.
This freed Arc up to stand behind everyone and chip away at the undead in the eastern room, throwing rock after rock.
He was able to take both of them down, with only a little bit of help from Del's ice projectiles.

Brorvec held the front line, his shield and dwarven armor taking hit after hit.
The undead corpses piled up in the hall, eventually blocking off the eastern half.
Brorvec got in a good shot with his mace, taking down the last of the undead within reach.

Yen, having run out of targets, vaulted the pile of corpses and charged to the end of the hall.
Taking out one of the three undead there, she was able to shake off her berserker rage.
Finally able to defend herself, she managed to held off the attacks of the other two undead next to her.
She seemed surprised by the idea that defense was an option, and she wandered for several seconds trying to figure out how to apply that new insight.

In the western room, Prur and Sorven were able to take down the third undead there.
In the hall, bunching up in a group behind Brorvec's shield and Edgar's faith, the party advanced step by step.
Two undead remained, both in full plate, swords at the ready.
They seemed unfazed by Edgar's faith, advancing into close contact with the group and raining down blows on them.
Edgar took a particularly nasty blow to the torso, relying on his faith and armor to keep it from being fatal.

Yen, still getting used to the idea of defending, dove to the ground to avoid a sword.
Getting back to her knees, she fought from behind Brorvec, struggling to hit the undead without hitting her allies.

Sorven was able to catch up to the group, getting in a few swipes with his staff.
Arc stepped up behind him, continuing to throw rocks and distract the undead from the attacks of the others.
Del, running close to exhaustion, did the same and and peppered the undead with ice.
Prur joined the group, preparing to assert his faith to help keep the undead at length.

## Outcomes

We called it a night with the two undead remaining.
Almost all of the characters are injured or exhausted, so the general thought is that we'll work our way back outside to the ruins and get a good night's rest.
Since we stopped mid-battle, we'll do XP next week.
