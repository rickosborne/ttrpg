# Session 36: From Beneath You, It Devours

Two mottled green tentacles shot up from the waves, each as wide as two people and three or four times as tall.
Paired rows of octopus-like suckers ran down their insides, with puckering discs the size of barrel heads.
The appendages twisted and bent, as if sensing the air and taking measure of their prey.
One settled in to the port of the foredeck, with the second amidships to starboard.

Guy took a quick pair of steps and a swipe at the starboard tentacle.
His glaive skittered across the depths-toughened skin, not even leaving a mark.
A second slash, this time with more concentrated aim, opened an arm's-length gash.
Bright green blood splashed across the deck.
Edgar took a shot with his sling, but it went wide.

With little warning, the tentacle arced and smashed down along a broad stretch of timber.
Guy, Edgar, and an orc crewman saw the attack in time, with another crewman not as lucky.
The orc was able to grab his mate and pull him into a roll, narrowly avoiding the strike.

Fave stepped past them, readying to strike, even as the appendage flew past him to come down a second time.
Guy and Sorven were the targets, sharing a glance as they saw the telegraphed attack.
The Strig was easily able to step out of the way, though his tensed muscles and worried glance toward his companion betrayed consideration of more drastic measures.

The old man, looking almost annoyed, stood his ground and made a complex warding gesture with his hands.
Something like a shimmering tortoise shell flashed and rippled across his form.
When the blow landed, the pattern sparked and faded, leaving the mage unruffled.
Beyond him, another sailor was caught off guard and knocked flying into the cabin wall behind them.

On the foredeck, Yenna mirrored Guy's movements to port, burying her axe in the blue-green flesh.
The tentacle seemed to not notice, slamming into the deck amidship.
One of the crew didn't see it coming and was crushed, letting out a gurgle as the limb flattened across him.
Yenna landed a second blow, green blood now flowing freely, and dodged as her target tried to retaliate.

The pair of limbs rose, accompanied by four more splashing up from beneath.
These newcomers did not seem to need to get their bearings, and within an instant the six arms were battering the ship.

## Surrounded by Suckers

Ophivial dodged an attack from port and brought up an ice sphere, frosty vapor dripping off it in the sun.
At almost the same instant, ice encased one half of Del's outstretched staff, coming to a jagged edge.
Ophivial didn't see the new starboard tentacle fling itself toward her.
Staff already aloft, Del jabbed its butt-end into her back.

With a pop of displaced air, she was suddenly beside him, several steps away from the devastation happening where she'd been.
Del threw her an apologetic frown as he saw her eyes go wide and her concentration lapse, the ice vanishing to mist between her hands.
His own weapon continued to pull moisture from the air for several more heartbeats, extruding spiky serrations and doubling in mass.

On the mid-deck, Edgar, in a single motion, drew both staves and landed a pair of wallops against the blue-gray flesh.
Guy's glaive arced in a slice, followed by a spray of the thin, too-cold blood.
Sorven stepped forward to jab his own staff at the target.
His first attack missed, eliciting a huff and a second jab.

The follow-up landed a crimson-silver spider web of spell-work which raced up and down the extremity.
Sorven brought his focus down to the deck, causing the limb to curl and drop into the water.
His eyes turned to the next nearest target while his fingers twitched against his staff, which continued to crackle with that same spider web energy.
Edgar threw him a nod before racing aft, yelling:

> How do we release the anchors?

As he ran past, he saw Vaelyn deep in concentration on a spell.
A crackle of lightning ran across her skin, and her movements seemed to quicken and blur.

Behind them on the poop deck, Kordova and Zamir worked to stay clear of another pair of coordinating tentacles.
Two crewmates tried to help with their polearms and spears, but were not up to the challenge and taken out by swipe and smash.

Beside them, Fave landed a trio of powerful blows against the starboard appendage.
Though his attacks didn't break the skin, the flesh where they landed bent and deformed, slowing the creatures responses.
A second series of blows had the same effect, until the third punched through, drawing back an arm covered in bright green ichor and tissue.
At the same time on the foredeck, Yenna landed her own third strike, this gash tall enough to fit a halfling.

## Shake, Rattle, and Roll

The ship lurched to port, throwing most off their feet.
Several crew were flung into railings, or into the sea.
Edgar and Sorven slid across the deck, but managed to catch themselves before going overboard.
Ophivial, still off-balance from Del's spell, couldn't react quickly enough, and went over the port side.
Del reached out his staff to try to catch her a second time, but couldn't connect.

The port tentacle smashed down toward Del and Yenna.
Yenna, amped and ready, gracefully stepped to one side and drew another heavy wound with her axe.
Del vanished with a pop, reappearing a step toward the bow.

Seeing the lethargy in the withdrawal, the mage stepped toward the rail and aimed his staff at the thickest part of the stalk, just above the water line.
The ice lance shot forward and through the flesh, splintering and exiting the far side in wrist-width shards.
The arm quivered and went limp, falling below the surface.

To aft, another tentacle slammed down, though its aim was off, landing in an area of clear deck.
Sorven took the opportunity to again jab with his staff, radiating out a second spider web of crimson and silver.
The crackling along his staff intensified, racing back and forth from tip to base.
Clenching his free hand, the ensnared appendage shivered and dropped below the waves.
Sweat formed along his grey brow, his eyes drooping half-closed as his hands worked independently, maintaining control of both spells at once.

At his back, Guy ripped a man-sized gash into his target, also causing it to drop beneath the waves.
One by one, the remaining tentacles retreated, before a second lurch again sent people flying.
Edgar and Vaelyn were knocked flat, but stayed on the ship, unlike several crew.
Guy, seeing the situation turn, immediately began tending to the surrounding wounded.

As everyone recovered, Kordova's basso voice rang clear:

> Ally!  Find Ophivial!

Del, already peering intently into the sea, yelled back:

> She's over here!

Another tentacle, this one seemingly undamaged, rose out of the water, whipping circles in the air.
Ophivial was firmly in its grasp, though a second glance showed she wasn't trying to free herself.
Instead, her hands worked to finish a complex spell before clapping down in tandem against her captor.

With a squelching shriek, the limb seemed to deflate and wither as its bodily fluids burst at every angle from it, from the curled tip holding the half-elf almost all the way to the water line.
The mage dropped free, spinning into a dive as she fell.
Del once again reached out with magic to try to catch her, but couldn't get the spell together fast enough.

## Overboard

Yenna, spotting a large coil of rope against the starboard rail, gave one end a heave over the side toward a bobbing sailor.
Without too much effort, she had him back onboard before running the length of the ship looking for more castaways.
Edgar and Fave worked to help crew back to their feet, while Guy and Colvin worked to triage the wounded.

Edgar, kneeling in a hasty but sincere prayer, reached out to lay a hand on Sorven's chest, donating some of his own vigor to the man he knew could use it.
A nod from the older man elongated into a morph, as he began the transition into his larger, feline form.
The crew who spotted the change began to react, but Edgar was able to calm them with a few words, and send them back to tending their mates.

A rumble and shake had everyone grabbing for the nearest hold, but this time the ship did not lurch.
Instead, the sea frothed and churned with bubbles, before clouding over with bright green and blue slicks.
A crewman cheered, shouting above the din:

> The beast may have passed!

Vaelyn, still moving in fast, jerky motions and blurry around the edges, approached Del.
In high-pitched, too-fast words she asked:

> Any sign of where she went?

He seemed to steel himself with a deep breath, which escaped slowly as the wind and seas calmed around them.
When his eyes opened again, he didn't have his usual sardonic frown, but instead an almost manic determination.
He jerked his thumb overboard, asking:

> I have an idea.
> Can you help me breathe in there, and keep it up for a bit?

She nodded, but he was already casting another spell she'd now seen several times.
As he drew out the final notes of his incantation, she touched her palm to his forehead, releasing a radiation of coral-pink energy along his face and neck.
Del jumped over the side, only realizing at the last moment to throw his staff back toward her before gravity took him.

## Under

Bobbing briefly on the surface, Del caught a second splash marking Yenna's entry into the water beside him.
A third splash and the large head of Lamikel showed briefly before disappearing below.
Yenna followed, turning to head under the ship.
Del, water beginning to seep beneath his armor, sank, took a deep breath from the sea itself, and released the spell he'd been holding.
Without needing to swim, his body curved down and began gliding toward the sea floor.

The water cleared as the clouds of leviathan ichor dispersed.
The beast itself was nowhere to be seen, though a shadow far beneath them may have marked its remains.

Out of the corner of his eye, Del noticed Lamikel turn to swim straight down.
The young mage didn't have the eyes of a tiger, but he trusted his friend.
Pushing his locomotive magics to their limits, he caught up with the cat and raced past him.

Dozens of fathoms passed, the sea getting colder, darker, and steadier.
Del began to make out the general shape of the dead beast.
A hulking monstrosity the size of ths ship itself, it had more appendages than they'd seen: nine, by Del's count.
A single, massive eye sat above a vicious-looking beak.

The eye, Del noticed, was riddled with large spikes of ice, intact in the frigid water.
Even as he drew closer, the dimming light leeched away first color and then detail from the world.

He tried incanting a spell, but even though he could breathe the water, he couldn't get enough sound out.
The alien environment gnawed at his concentration as he worked to construct the spell in his mind alone, but on his fourth attempt he was able to summon light.
It projected from his palm for dozens of yards, bringing daylight to this place which had never seen it.
Though now he was able to see his search could have been much worse: the remains were on the very edge of a shelf above depths his light could not penetrate.

Searching quickly, Del was able to count out three human-shaped bodies among the beast's still-twitching carcass.
Ophivial's was easy to recognize.
Del hooked his arms beneath hers, willing them both back along the path to the faint glimmer above.

Breaking the surface of the water, then rising to float slightly above it as he held Ophivial's face to the sun, he called up to the ship:

> Toss me my staff!

Edgar arced it toward him in a perfect toss, which Del caught with uncharacteristic skill.
Reality bent and twisted around Ophivial, as she and a good deal of seawater vanished and reappeared on deck amidships.
Del floated up and touched down, running to meet with Colvin as the halfling knelt over the sailmistress.
Turning to Vaelyn, Del gave a slow, sincere nod:

> Thank you.  That made all the difference.

The healer worked several spells and gave physical ministrations, but after several moments his work slowed.
Leaning back on his haunches, he sighed and looked up at the gathered crowd:

> I'm sorry, she's gone.

## Outcomes

* 4XP for everyone, with +2XP for Del for going above any beyond with Ophivial's recovery.
* Edgar spent 1XP for a re-roll on a DX check.  Still failed, but not critically.
* Sorven spent 1XP for a re-roll on a _Control Limb_ spell.
* Del spent 1XP for a re-roll of a _Blink Other_, and still failed.
