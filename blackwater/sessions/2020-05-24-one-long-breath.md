# Session 16: One Long Breath

## The Party

Everyone was present, with no substitutions!

## Summary

Sorven walked among the party, sealing their wounds as they gathered and talked through the plan for the rest of the evening.
The discussion meandered through a number of plans, including going back up topside or bedding down for the night in the summoning chamber.
The best estimate for the current time still had several hours of daylight, so the party decided to push through.
Edgar repeated what he had seen in his vision: a swim to a chamber filled with water where the necromancers waited.

Del, looking at the book still in Edgar's hands, had an idea.
He proposed recreating a short-term version of the binding which held the curse in stasis, but instead using it to bind protective or helpful spells to the party's equipment.
The binding spells could then release upon the owner's command, up to a few hours after the binding took effect.
It would take a little of Del's concentration for each of the binding spells, but it could be done.

The possibilities were overwhelming, leading to a long debate as the party walked back to the shaft.
Protective magics could be bound to armor, and then activated just before running into battle.
Harmful magics could enhance the damage from weapons, timed to activate when the weapons were taken in hand.
The thinned barriers to other realms could be warped and wrapped to allow someone to escape with but a snap of their fingers.

Practicality won the day.
Brorvec expressed concern about being able to navigate a water-filled room at his height.
As the party agreed that Brorvec had done an excellent job keeping everyone safe, this need became the clear winner.
The ritual only took a short time and a little energy from him, Del, and the two Strig.
When complete, Brorvec had but to click his heels together and concentrate to be able to walk on the surface of any water with the same surety he'd have on stone — for one minute, anyway.
Del gave Brorvec a ridiculous and irrelevant magic phrase, silently pleased when the Dwarf gave him a solemn nod as he mouthed the phrase several times.

Arc and Del did their floating trick down the shaft, with Del stopping at the next lower floor while Arc stayed above.
Edgar was able to climb down the rope without incident, for which Del gave him a tilt of the head which Edgar couldn't decide was mocking or acknowledging.
Instead of Sorven climbing down, Arc was able to lift and lower him between the levels.

Guy climbed down next, though he wasn't quite able to keep his grip.
Del, having prepared for this eventuality, was able to catch him mid-air as he dropped past and float him back to join the rest.
The effort cost him something, but Sorven was right there to share from his reserves.

Yenna and Brorvec followed, each making it on their own, though Brorvec seemed chagrined by Yenna's knot-work as he climbed out of his harness.
Arc, antsy to keep moving, took several trips to ferry down the scrolls, books, and other gear from the upper level.
The party lugged everything back to the central chamber, separating out the potions and scrolls, before making their way back to the well and skull capstone.

While everyone now assumed that rotating the capstone would reveal a passage from the well, Edgar expressed concerns the party might miss something if no one was in the water when it happened.
He convinced Guy and Yenna to knot him into a harness, and Brorvec to lower him into the well.
They worked out a signal for Brorvec to haul Edgar back: three quick tugs on the rope.

Guy and Yenna placed the Black Sun medallions into the skull's eyes, under the watchful third eye of Del, looking out for trap enchantments.
They turned the skull capstone counterclockwise to face the north, as specified by the inscription.
The mechanism made a small click before slowly rotating itself back to its starting position.
In the well, Edgar made small splashing sounds as a stream of bubbles broke the surrounding surface.

Edgar dove, followed seconds later by Arc.
Almost a full minute passed before Brorvec felt the three quick jerks and pulled them back to the surface.
The men took turns explaining that a passage had opened up on the floor of the well, several yards down.
The passage led to the east, back under the skull and for a number of yards beyond that.

Arc, excited, dove a second time and was gone even longer.
He returned with blood streaming from his nose, coughing up icy water and gasping for air.
Sorven was able to ease his distress, allowing him to tell everyone what he'd seen.
Taking some chalk from Guy's bag, he was able to draw out a three-chambered map, highlighting the extent of the standing water.
He also related how the "one long breath" of the passage was going to be more than most of the party could handle.

Sorven, now just as excited to be so close to their goal, began working a ritual to carve away the stone floor behind the capstone.
Soliciting the help of most of the party, he was able to carve away enough such that even the Strig would have no problem getting down into the water.
The effort cost him, the strain evident on his lined face.

The discussion about binding protective spells resumed.
It seemed like each of the party members advocated for protecting someone else.
In the end, everyone agreed that keeping Yenna up and running was likely the best way to keep the necromancers occupied.
The ritual took five tries, chipping away at the reserves of everyone in the party as they all participated.
It ultimately worked — binding a spell to provide Yenna with head-to-toe armor — though the effort exhausted everyone.
The party spent the better part of an hour resting, during which time Del instructed the non-magic-users how to funnel energy into ongoing spells, while he provided the concentration to keep it running.

One by one, each stood and ordered themselves to go down the hole.

## Outcomes

2 XP for everyone.
