# Session 29: Waitin' to Tap That

Edgar felt the hair prickle along the back of his neck, just before finding himself yards from where he'd been.
The Lady threw him a smirk and a wave from the other side of the arcane wall, before turning to face Sorven.
The old man seemed unconcerned by her attention, calmly beginning a slow spell that drew energy from deep beneath them all.

She seemed to recognize the spell, sneering as she raised a hand and arced lightning between them.
Sorven turned but was constrained by the requirements of the spell and unable to dodge the attack.
It landed squarely against his rib cage, burning a line across his robe.
A wave of muscular spasms radiated outward as he kept up his arcane motions.

Rushing to Edgar, Vaelyn laid hands on him, then turned and did the same to Fave.
Her will congealed into the healing magics of life itself, stitching closed the burned and split flesh of the two men.
Fave found he was once again able to put weight on the leg which had taken the spears.
Edgar, feeling the burden of his injuries leave him, closed his eyes and reached out a hand toward the barrier.
Divine energy buzzed warmly out from him, drawing the momentary attention of the Lady, but having no more significant effect.

## Despite All Her Rage

In the hall, the Strig rushed to catch up with the others.
Guy, squinting to understand what he was seeing, pointed at a cluster of stones in the floor.
Yenna took a wide step around them, but knew as soon as her foot landed that something was wrong.
A tingle ran up from her heels, but faded into nothingness, with no obvious effect.
Gathering speed, she got another two strides before she felt it again.

> Magic!

She snarled as her rage took hold, growing angry at every last spell she couldn't see coming toward her.
The haughty mage (what was his name?) turned toward her, barely able to keep hold of the large spears he clearly did not have the skill to handle.
His words tugged at the back of her mind, distracting her from a third wash of magic across her skin:

> I can get you closer to her.

The walls shifted around her, causing her stomach to turn.
A raspy hiss beside her drew her attention just long enough to see the lich wave a hand at her.
Again the walls shifted.
She found herself surrounded by idiots standing between her and the undead target of her fury.

Yenna's senses rebelled at the chaotic input, forcing her eyes closed as she gulped down air.
When they opened again, the scene before Yenna seemed like the setup to a bad joke.
A half-elf to one side, Strig to the other, and a human monk between her and her quarry.
Growling, the axes at the ends of her long arms seemed to fly forward of their own will.

The monk was a blur in front of her.
He took both strikes on his forearms, getting in beneath the blades, driving them wide.
With a whispered step he was beside her, his shin sweeping her legs out from under her.
She hit the ground hard, amplifying her frustration.

Del pressed himself against the wall, trying to stay out of line-of-sight with the Lady.
He tried to get the attention of the people piled up against the barrier:

> Here.  I need you right here.

Edgar moved first, but Vaelyn was closer.
With a single step she was in reach of Del's outstretched hand.
She knew what was coming, but it didn't help.
The world shifted around her and she found herself within arm's reach of the Lady, the blue flames around her throwing off a palpable heat, the chants of the elder mage suddenly crisp and only yards away.
The sensory overload was too much and she found herself struggling to hold down her dinner.

The lich reached out to the half-elf, gathering magic between them.
Sorven's spell finished first.

Beneath the feet of his target, the stone floor seemed to part like the waters of a bath.
Rich, black earth flowed up around the form of Lady Dunwich, hardening into a crystalline stone darker than obsidian.
The shapeless mass shot downward, disappearing as the stone flowed back into place, looking undisturbed, as if nothing had happened.
The entire movement was so fast it was barely an after-image in the eyes of those who saw it.

## All You Zombies

Umbral tendrils of an arcane haze seemed to boil away from Sorven as he collapsed to the floor, gasping from the effort.
Vaelyn rushed to him, but found him physically sound.
Del followed as the barrier dropped, verifying the Lady was out of the picture.
Behind them, Yenna's strong lungs could be heard working to control her breathing.

Edgar strode down the slope of the drainage floor to Gerin at the bottom.
She still looked drowsy, agitated, and not entirely there, so he tried to calm her by talking through his efforts at freeing her from her manacles:

> ... so it kind of can take a minute to locate all the tumblers, and as you can see this is a pretty nice lock!
> But ... there's the first tumbler!

Vaelyn was considering how she could help, before her attention was ripped away by her daughter's voice and quick footsteps approaching from the other room:

> Is everyone dead in here?
> Because there are zombies coming in the hallway.

The group fell into formation at the bend in the tunnel.
Three in front dropped to their knees, with another four behind them, all with crossbows at the ready.
Their armor was piecemeal and bore no identifying colors or insignia, but their edged weapons were sharp in the torchlight.

Fave and Rayna passed each other in a sprint.
As Vaelyn welcomed her daughter into her arms, she tapped the gnarled wood of her staff to Guy's chest.
The surrounding air seemed to accrete into something smooth and organic, before fading to invisibility.
The Strig nodded and ran after Fave.

The commotion catching Del's attention, he stepped forward into the same doorway that had blocked their path.
Barely above the din, he cautioned those around him:

> Step back.  Right here.

He didn't give them time to comply.
Remembering how effective the disorienting mist had been in the sept, he improvised his own version with a swirl of his staff.
The silvery cloud expanded out from him with a thumping pop, taking the cries of the wounded down to a dull buzz.
He looked back and saw Yenna, Vaelyn, and Rayna standing in the mist with him, translucent shimmers of arcane energy enveloping them before disappearing.

## Like Bringing a Crossbow to a Glaive Fight

In the tunnel, the trio of kneeling newcomers loosed their bolts in unison at the charging monk.
Fave managed to dodge the first two, but the third caught him in the forearm, embedding itself along the bone.
Guy was steps behind him, his large form quickly drawing the attention of the remaining four interlopers.
Again in unison, four twangs preceded four bolts, all targeting the large man, center mass.

None landed.

Vaelyn's spell caught the mass of bolts inches from Guy's form, spinning them in place instantly before returning them along their paths.
In a maneuver obviously practiced many times, six of the seven in the fusillade line dropped to the floor.
The two slowest weren't able to clear the projectiles, taking mortal hits.

Guy didn't miss a beat, lunging forward with his readied glaive at the back of one of the prone men.
Its razor-thin tip went through multiple layers of armor, flesh, and bone, with little resistance.
The man twitched and sunk back to the stone floor.

The standing thug whipped an axe at the Strig, who was still off-balance from his attack.
Slicing deep through the armor across his chest, the blade came free with a large splash of bright red blood.

Fave flew past the stunned larger man, an airborne blur.
Fists followed feet, pummeling the goon until he dropped to the floor.

Vaelyn stepped up behind them, already shouting in Mellinarathi.
As her staff stretched past her teammates, a languid, yellow-brown energy spread out across the scrambling mass.
The same spell which had trapped her in the previous timeline now held her attackers fast.
Guy took immediate advantage, skewering a man struggling to get to his feet.

In two long strides, Yenna was close to follow.
With the ululating cry familiar to her companions, she loosed one of her chakrams.
Without much room in the tunnel, she had to carom it off a stone wall, sparks flying at the point of impact.
The ringed blade found its home in the same chest now releasing Guy's weapon.
It sank into the collarbone of the man, lodging there as he sank to the floor.

An eighth attacker, a swarthy halfling man several yards away from the others, fired at Fave from just beyond the torchlight.
The monk's arm blurred and the bolt hit the floor, ineffective.
A second attacker tried to use the opportunity to get in a slice with a scimitar, but again the young man was too fast.
Reaching inside the swing, Fave chopped at the man's arm hard enough to bat away the attack.

Fave pressed the counter with another punch and kick.
Trying to avoid the blade, the punch went wide, while the kick connected with the man's knee, taking it out from under him.
A sweeping kick to the other leg dropped the man onto his back.

In the oubliette, Edgar paused his narrative on the finer points of lockpicks to throw a question to the shrouded doorway:

> Need help?

Del, watching the outmatched attackers fall one by one, casually drew a finger across the air.
A frosty spike followed the motion, the floating shard barely a dart, but vibrating with unspent energy, waiting to be released.

> No.  We've got this.

The arc of the glaive swung wide over the floor of dead and dying, giving its target ample time to dodge.
It was only as the blade drew a thin line across the attacker's chest that Guy was able to see his target was the lone woman of the group.
Yenna was quick to follow up with a second ricocheting chakram, but again the woman was able to step back and avoid the disc.

The halfling, seeing the tide turn, yelled to his remaining crew:

> Let's get out of here, boys!

The last half was over his shoulder, as he'd already spun and was making his way back into the darkness.
Grunting with the effort against Vaelyn's spell, the woman managed to get out of it, sprinting into the darkness after him.

Fave didn't give the nearest goon the chance.
Three rapid punches and the man was down, unconscious.
