# Session 34: Merchants and Medallions

The 22nd of Flocktime found the group preparing for the expedition, now just a week away.

Edgar once again made the walk down to Nelora's shop, and was delighted to find her in.
She'd amassed quite the collection of odds and ends, impressive given the tiny size of her establishment.
Making several trips to and from the back room, she showed off almost two dozen items.
Edgar settled on a few utility items, and a fine-quality mirror he though Vaelyn might find useful in her spells.

He asked her to set aside some items until the next day.
They came out to some 45 Gold Talents, which Edgar hoped could instead be settled via trade later in the day.

Back at the Skeleton Key, Del spent the better part of the morning and afternoon locked in his room with the three medallions from the Order of the Magi.
Emerging every hour and a half, he doled out tidbits of information between hungrily stuffing his face.
It looked like the effort was taking a toll, though Sorven seemed pleased to see his instruction on faster recovery was being put to good use.

Del explained how the emeralds in the center of the medallions were enchanted to act as energy storage.
They were not natural powerstones, and would not recharge overnight, but they each had enough charge to power several large works.

He looked dubious as he explained that he'd caught a glimpse of something more when working with Sorven's medallion.
He wasn't sure what the additional enchantment was, and it seemed to resist his attempts to learn more about it.
Holding all three medallions in front of him to show their similarity, he admitted the other two likely had the same enchantment, but he'd failed to notice it.

Sorven dryly suggested they throw the lot of them into the ocean.
Del readily agreed, mumbling something about "bamfing them to Giant country".

That evening found Edgar returning to Nelora's.
After pleasantries, he laid a wrapped bundle onto the counter top.
Careful not to touch it, he revealed a vicious-looking dagger covered in fine jewels and scrollwork.

Nelora, similarly cautious, perked up and asked if she could take the item in the back for more thorough analysis.
Edgar wanted to be present, but she flatly refused, citing the need to protect her trade secrets.
He got her to promise to share all she learned, and a deal was struck.
Returning a quarter-hour later, Nelora's curious demeanor had fallen into something more like pity and confusion.

> This is worth a lot more than you think.
> The silver and gem work alone are worth double what you're asking.
> And I don't know what the enchantments are, but the intensity and number would make it more like ten times that price.

She offered a deal to find a buyer for it, for a one-third commission.
Edgar demurred, explaining he'd need to talk with his friends about it.
Instead, he changed the topic to request a pair of gloves appropriate for fine work.
Nelora pointed him toward _The Naked Sheep_, a high-end tailor on Royal St.

Reviewing their funds, the group decided they couldn't quite afford the asking price of Flynn's magic bear figurine.
Yenna was heartbroken, sulking and kicking door jambs the rest of the day.
Del sent Nick to find Flynn, with a short note canceling their appointment, and explaining they'd meet back up after he got back.

The following morning, the 23rd of Flocktime, found Del again sequestered in his chamber teasing apart the enchantments.
This time the target was the dagger.
He'd looked at it previously, and had picked up on its necromantic nature, but he'd been unable to read anything more.
This time he fared no better, though he was able to glean one thing: the magic was so incredibly alien, it didn't seem to be based in the same systems used by any known humanoid race.

Vaelyn was intrigued by this, citing her connection to Fey magic.
Spending her own hour teasing its magics apart, her best estimation was that the dagger was demonic in origin.
Edgar, who had been looking on with the enchanted spyglass, said that aligned with what he was able to discern, which was that the dagger may not have been forged, inasmuch created out of some creature's will.

Gavin, bleary-eyed from a late night with his books, offered another theory: the scrollwork on the handle and hilt place the dagger in the time of The Troubles.
For those not familiar, he gave a brief recounting of the era, including dark anecdotes of Empress Tatiana.
His intuition was that the dagger was actually Drow in origin.

Sorven, his interest piqued, expressed how he would like to test the dagger.
Edgar thought this would be a very bad idea, but his young monk bodyguard was already interested and working with Sorven on the parameters for the test.
An hour later, Fave offered a live chicken in a sack to the old man, who promptly slaughtered it with the dagger over a clay basin.

Losing interest almost immediately, Sorven explained that the enchantment felt unlikely to activate for anything less than the death or sacrifice of an intelligent creature.
Edgar, satisfied neither Sorven nor Fave was likely to go further than this, made his way back to Nelora's.

Showing off the crystal ball, Nelora agreed Edgar's offering was a fine item.
They spent more than an hour haggling, with Edgar losing ground and Nelora steadfast in her offer.
She eventually agreed to 86 Plamarise Gold Crowns ($21,500) plus the agreed items.

Del, Yenna, and Fave made a trip to Mad Cow Leatherworks.
Yenna's fine mail shirt was ready, but Del's drider leather set was not.
The artisans explained the skin was proving harder to work with than they'd anticipated, and would take three more days.
To mollify the cranky young man, they explained that it was also proving more resilient, leading to what they expected to be a lighter total weight.

Fave commissioned repairs to his leather jacket, which had been thoroughly worked over during the Strig attack.
The cost would only be 5 Marks, and would also be ready on the 26th with Del's set.
As they were working out the details, Del and Yenna took their leave, while Edgar and Sorven arrived.
With Fave, they spent the better part of the afternoon trying on various armor configurations.

Orders placed, they moved on to _The Naked Sheep_.
The craftsman at the high-end shop, Alberto, listened patiently as Edgar detailed what he was looking for.
While the initial estimate was three weeks, Edgar was able to get them to commit to the morning of the 29th by paying double the price.
Fave pointed out they'd be getting on a boat, but Edgar was confident the business could meet the date.
He put down half of the 12 Gold Royal cost, with the other half due on pickup.
