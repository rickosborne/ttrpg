# Session 19: She's Gone For Good, Right?

## The Party

Everyone was present, with no substitutions!

## Summary

Sinking a glaive into the back of the last skeletal minion, Guy looks across the chamber to see Lamikel pounce once again toward the lady lich.
Dunwich's form twists in space and vanishes, reappearing an arm's length away.
Lamikel growls as he lands, furor boiling over.

Dunwich laughs at the tiger, reaching for the gleaming rod on the table behind her: "My revenge will be long and sweet."
Lamikel turns to pounce again, open wounds and singed flesh seeping blood.
In a sonorous tone which reverberates between the stone walls, the lady commands the tiger to "Stop, go back!".
He struggles, but is unable to break past the force of her will.
The effort costs him, however, and he finally succumbs to his wounds.
Shrinking to the floor, the battered feline form pulls tight to reveal the old man Sorven once again.

Using the momentary distraction, Edgar is able to get to the rod.
Arc makes a telekinetic grab for it, but is unable to wrest it away.
Edgar, unable to find any readable inscription or other indications of how to use the weapon, points it at the lich and yells: "Hephaestas!"
Nothing happens.

Even with her tall Strig form, Yenna struggles to move through the thigh-deep water.
A dank, frigid bow-wave pushing out ahead of her, she makes her way to the only dry land she can see: an empty coffin.
She slips and loses her footing, grabbing the attention of Lady Dunwich.
Rod lost, pair of massive Strig bearing down on her, her face twists with disgust: "I will find you and make you suffer."
Her form once again warps in a flicker of pseudo-motion before vanishing, but does not reappear this time.

Without hesitation, Guy sprints to Sorven and begins applying first aid to stabilize him.
Yenna, after loosing a scream of frustration, takes a steadying breath and closes her eyes.
Shaking away her rage, she rushes to Sorven's other side and gets to work applying bandages.
Both are mildly distracted by the low, steady drone of a Dwarven song rising up from the grate at the top of the stairs.

Arc, taking several moments to concentrate on the lock, is able to open his cage and lower himself to the ground.
He and Edgar make their way over to Brorvec's oubliette, where the former is able to shine some light and pick the lock, while the latter ties up and lowers some rope.
Brorvec's dirge fades to a whisper as he makes it topside and looks around: "Where's Del?"

The other two notice Arc struggling to untie the knot he'd just made, eventually just hacking through the line to free it.
This sets off a barrage of sarcastic mockery between the three for the next several minutes as they work their way around the room, picking up valuable-looking objects and dropping them in the Dwarf's ever-burgeoning backpack.
The scene is peppered with Edgar intoning random words and pointing the rod at various objects around the room, always to no effect.

Content they've not missed anything too shiny, Arc and Brorvec head back to the central chamber in search of Del.
Brorvec, paying karmically and comically for the insults he'd offered Arc, slips and splashes multiple times while attempting to extricate himself from the cistern.
Arc finds Del, pale and unmoving but still conscious, with his back against the stone well.
He's able to stabilize the mage, catching him up on Lady Dunwich's retreat and Sorven's tiger form.
Del, for some reason Arc finds odd, is completely unsurprised to hear about Lamikel.
Changing the subject, Del fishes through his pockets and hands over the set of keys he found in the hidden room.

Brorvec, beginning to worry about the stability of his overflowing bag, fetches the party's backpacks from the entrance area.
Arc, thinking of the poor shape Sorven was in, realizes it will take several hours to get the mage to the point where he can be extracted.
Grabbing the rations, he ducks underwater and does his bubble-of-air trick to get the still-dry food back to the other room.

He finds Edgar staring up at a skeleton chained to a wall.
The form is easily larger even than any Strig they've ever seen.
Edgar takes out his notebook and takes methodical notes and drawings, working his way around the room.
Casually, and only half paying attention, he and Arc hold a conversation about burning the place to the ground, to prevent its further misuse.
Arc, arguing against it, points out the group could convert it into a sort of guild hall, away from the prying and greedy eyes of Blackwater.

Hours later, Arc is able to get a stable Sorven bubbled and floated back into the central room.
One item at a time, they present their loot to Del for magical inspection.
He's able to separate out an emerald powerstone, spyglass, large book, silver dagger, and bracers, though he warns it will take some time and a great deal of energy to fully analyze them.
Without Sorven, still unconscious, to help Del recharge, it will take hours if not days.

The others ask Del if he's seen Sorven do enough healing magic to allow him to improvise something.
Del thinks it's a bad idea, but he gives it a shot.
It takes hours, several pauses and restarts, and help from everyone in an intricate ceremony, but their patience is rewarded with the flush of color returning to the old man's cheeks, and the creeping closure of his open wounds.
